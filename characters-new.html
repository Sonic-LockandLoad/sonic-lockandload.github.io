            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is the fastest character in Sonic: Lock & Load, balanced between combat and platforming. He's designed to be accessible to first time players, but he also has a high skill ceiling for more skilled players.</p>
            <p>Sonic focuses mostly on fast FPS action, having weapons that aren't that powerful alone, but are designed to be used in tandem, for weapon combos. His movement abilities are pretty powerful, but uncontrollable if you don't know how to use him.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Sonic can kick enemies at any time. Damage is doubled if Sonic is mid-air. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> when facing wall <br> Sonic can jump off of walls to gain extra height and distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can jump mid-air. Wall jumping will give him a free double jump. If Sonic is underwater, he can jump infinite times.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Step</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> on the ground <br> Sonic can quickly sidestep to avoid attacks. A Quick Step will render Sonic invulnerable for 10 tics (just over a quarter of a second). Hold down any movement keys during a Quick Step to move in that direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Homing Snap</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> mid-air <br> Homing Snap allows Sonic to home in on any attackable target if he's not too far away. As long as you keep looking at the target, Sonic will be suspended mid-air for a couple of seconds. <br> You can follow up by attacking with a kick by pressing <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd>, or by pressing <kbd>Jump</kbd> to escape. <br> By default, a reticle will appear whenever you're looking at a target you can Homing Snap to while Sonic is in the air. This can be changed to be always shown or not shown at all.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - The Sacred Sword.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sword Swing</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing Caliburn from side to side. Rapidly press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to perform a combo. Hits multiple times in a single swing, which can stunlock enemies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Sonic zoom forward at high speed. The longer you hold, the faster it'll go. Cannot be held mid-air.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can thrust himself downward with Caliburn and slam into the ground. Works as a low-range AoE attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soul Surge</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> with Caliburn, then <kbd>Fire</kbd> when blade glows white <br> The Soul Surge is back and better than ever! During a Homing Snap, while holding Caliburn, Sonic will be able to attack with an extra-powerful strike that destroys any single enemy. You have to attack with the right timing, so make sure you don't mess it up! Unlike in SatBK, you won't be able to use it consecutively. Costs 400 Chaos Energy. Sonic is invincible while the attack is charging.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Pistol</strong> - A burst pistol crossed with a railgun.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burst Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three bullets in quick succession. Can be spammed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recoil Burst</strong> - Charge with <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd>, press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to use <br> Charge a railgun blast, and then fire. The longer you charge, the more powerful the attack will be, and the more energy it'll consume.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Shotty</strong> - An automatic shotgun with an adjustable spread.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a wide spread of pellets. Can be spammed with the right timing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Force Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a tight spread of pellets that sends Sonic backwards. Can be performed twice in a row, but needs to reload after firing.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Shuriken Crossbow</strong> - A modified crossbow that fires shurikens at high speed.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shuriken Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a shuriken that tears through multiple enemies. Has a bit of a long cooldown.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V</strong> - An enhanced plasma rifle that has the ability to heal.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire a stream of plasma. Fires in short bursts.</kbd></li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. V <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V can heal Sonic.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Rioter</strong> - A rocket launcher that can be rapidly fired.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rocket Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rocket. Deals more damage if fired while Sonic is in the air.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Detonation</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rocket Rioter <br> Sonic will remotely make any rockets he fired explode.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=amy.png id=character />
            <h3>Amy Rose</h3>
            <p>Amy is slower than everyone else, but she has the most control over her movement, making platforming sections easier than either of the Sonics.</p>
            <p>In combat, she takes increased damage, so prioritising defence or evading attacks is important.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Amy's kick is slower than Sonic's, and doesn't do much damage. It's more useful for getting enemies away from you. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Amy can jump mid-air. Unlike with Sonic, the double jump is typically needed to jump longer gaps that Sonic can easily cross with a single jump.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> To get through tight spaces, press the <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> button to slide! Amy's Slide will give her a sudden burst of speed, and have her height set to be low, so she can slide under gaps too small to pass through normally. She can also slide over gaps like in Crash 4. However, it does not deal damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> during Slide <br> Amy can jump during Slide to have her jump height boosted. If she jumps out of a slide while mid-air, it'll be treated as a normal jump, and she'll still be able to double jump afterwards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Piko Piko Hammer</strong> - Amy's signature weapon.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Piko Strike</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> Swing the Piko Piko Hammer forwards. Has a small crit chance. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Quickly nullify all incoming damage, reflect projectiles and telekinetically attack hitscanning enemies. Any damage Amy normally takes while parrying instead withdraws from her Chaos Energy, and if she's out of Energy, attempts to parry won't protect her at all.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hammer Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> at the exact moment the Piko Piko Hammer attacks <br> Jump a lot higher than a normal jump will take you, using the Piko Piko Hammer to boost Amy upwards.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Silent Rose</strong> - A silenced pistol.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silenced Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd><br> Fire a single bullet. Doesn't wake up enemies unless it hits them.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Precision Shotgun</strong> - A highly accurate shotgun with a precision scope.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shotgun Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a very tight spread of pellets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precise Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Precision Shotgun <br> Fire an ultra-precise, concentrated shot. Can be cancelled if you let go of <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV</strong> - More powerful than the Mk. V, but uses more energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Continuously fire plasma balls. Press <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> to kick and make the projectiles faster and more powerful.</kbd></li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV can heal Amy. It heals slower than the Mk. V does.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Missiles</strong> - A rapid-fire missile launcher.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three rockets in quick succession.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triple Launch</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three rockets simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <h3>Classic Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Classic Sonic is designed for people who prefer platforming, and don't necessarily want to focus on FPS combat that much.</p>
            <p>His abilities aren't nearly as broken as any of the other characters' abilities, so he focuses more on fundamental platforming using his abilities to assist him, and his weapons are simply faster classic DOOM weapons.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> A quick rolling attack. If Sonic is standing still, his height won't change during Spin Attack. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Insta-Shield</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can perform a Spin Attack mid-air. This move will temporarily turn Sonic invincible, and give him a short hop. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Sonic Thok</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> or <kbd>Jump</kbd> twice <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Offhand</kbd> before v1.4)</span> + optionally any movement keys <br> Sonic can thok, flinging himself forwards at high speed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unarmed</strong> - While unarmed, Sonic gains access to his Drift and Spin Dash abilities.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drift</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Sonic can skid across the floor at high speed, generating Chaos Energy. If he uses it in the air, it'll be a lot slower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> to charge, then release <br> <em>The</em> signature technique. Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Spin Dash to Spin Dash Jump, and you can hold <kbd>Move Back</kbd> to slow down the Spin Dash. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drop Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air until you hit the ground <br> An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wall Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> against a wall after jumping <br> An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Blaster</strong> - A plasma rifle with fast projectiles. Quite overpowered. Please nerf.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plasma Stream</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> Fire a stream of plasma projectiles.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - An automatic shotgun with a burst fire.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speedy Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rapid shotgun blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burst Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a quintuple burst fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Rain</strong> - A turbo-charged chaingun with a wide spread.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bullet Rain</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a barrage of incredibly inaccurate bullets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - A rapid fire rocket launcher that can be used for rocket jumping.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stream Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of rockets that launch targets far, including Sonic. Sonic takes less damage from his own rockets, so you can get away with rocket jumping.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <h3>Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Shadow is fundamentally similar to Sonic, but having a jump height higher than everyone else's.</p>
            <p>Shadow's combat is a <em>lot</em> simpler than the rest of the cast, and doesn't have nearly as much depth as Sonic's, but he can typically get through most combat encounters easier than everyone else, since his weapons and abilities are the most powerful among the cast. Shadow is a good pick for beginners.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when close to a target <br> Shadow can destroy most enemies with a single punch. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Spear</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Shadow can fire a Chaos Spear that homes in on targets. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Snap</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> A less powerful Chaos Control that lets Shadow teleport. Can only be used twice mid-air. If Shadow is holding the Chaos Emerald, he'll gain an additional Chaos Snap. Shadow is invincible during this technique.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Shovel</strong> - The ultimate symbol of respect. The High Shovel deals a powerful blow to whatever enemy Shadow hits with it. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shovel Smash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing the High Shovel forward and destroy anything unlucky enough to be in your way.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Troll Slaiying Knife</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzEHKyUZp4&t=354s">They cant troll you if there dead!</a> The ultimate troll slaiying weapon, which deals enough damage to one-shot basically every enemy in the game. Can activate attackable switches.</li>

                </ul>
                <li><strong>Quartenary Decimator</strong> - A quad-barreled, super powerful shotgun with quite a bit of recoil.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decimation Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire an ungodly amount of pellets.</li>
