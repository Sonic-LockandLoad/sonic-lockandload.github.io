            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is the fastest character in Sonic: Lock & Load, being accessible to first time players but having a high skill ceiling. Sonic's abilities revolve around fast movement and high agility, but he isn't as easy to control as the others.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - The Sacred Sword. Hits multiple times in a single swing, which can stunlock enemies.</li>

            </ul>

            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <h3>Classic Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Classic Sonic is aimed more towards beginners, lacking his Modern counterpart's powerful abilities, but with abilities and a gameplay style of his own. He typically handles better than Modern Sonic, but can still be uncontrollable at times.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - Yes. Classic Sonic can punch enemies.</li>

                <li><strong>Drift</strong> - Classic Sonic can skid across the floor at high speed, generating Chaos Energy. If he uses it in the air, it'll be a lot slower.</li>
                <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - <em>The</em> signature technique. Classic Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny.

            </ul>

            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <h3>Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Shadow has the same base speed as Sonic, as well as the ability to teleport around the arena. His weapons are the most powerful in the game, but use up the most energy. He's typically aimed at people who want to blow everything up.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Dual Assimilator</strong> - A dual rocket launcher that can NOT be used for rocket jumping. Don't even try.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
