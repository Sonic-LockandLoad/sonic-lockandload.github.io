            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is the fastest character in Sonic: Lock & Load, with super high mobility and a multitude of ways to get around the environment, both on the ground and in the air.</p>
            <p>Sonic focuses mostly on super fast action, and his weapons are balanced around the high speeds he can reach.</p>
            <p>A lot of his weapons and movement skills can be tied together for high speed and fast action gameplay.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Sonic can kick enemies at any time. Damage is doubled if Sonic is mid-air. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Homing Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when Homing Reticle appears <br> Sonic can dash towards a target in a split second and kick it. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can jump mid-air. Wall jumping will give him a free double jump. If Sonic is underwater, he can jump infinite times.</li>
                <li><strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air, while next to a wall <br> Sonic can jump off of walls to gain extra height and distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can thrust himself downward and slam into the ground. Works as a low-range AoE attack. Jump immediately after a Slam Attack to jump higher.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Step</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> Sonic can quickly sidestep to avoid attacks or move fast quickly. A Quick Step will render Sonic invulnerable for 10 tics (just over a quarter of a second). Hold down any movement keys during a Quick Step to move in that direction. Can be cancelled into a jump or crouch slide.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - Sonic's personal talking sword from a dimension of stories.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sword Swing</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing Caliburn from side to side. Rapidly press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to perform a combo. Attacks in a wide radius, but is fairly weak. Probably not a good idea to use for a tough enemy if you just go in swinging. Does not trigger enemies' pain state.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> when enemy attacks <br> Up close to an enemy, attack with Caliburn within 0.2 seconds (6 <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Definitions#Units_of_time">tics</a>) of an enemy's attack to parry it, turning the enemy's attack against itself, removing over a third of its health and flinging them far away! Parrying only works on the first swing, and won't be active during a sword combo. And remember, you have to be close enough to an enemy to parry its attacks!</li>
                    <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Sonic zoom forward at high speed. The longer you hold, the faster it'll go. Press <kbd>Jump</kbd> to perform a Boost Jump, which preserves the Boost's momentum and gives Sonic a height boost. Cannot be held mid-air.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accel Boost</strong> - <kbd>Forward</kbd> + <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> at the same time <br> Accel Boost will make Sonic blast off at his maximum Boost speed. This can be used to quickly zip to a far-away point, in case the regular inital Boost speed isn't enough for you. Functionally identical to the Boost.<br></li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Pistol</strong> - A burst pistol crossed with a railgun.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burst Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three bullets in quick succession. Can be spammed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recoil Burst</strong> - Charge with <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd>, press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to use <br> Charge a railgun blast, and then fire. The longer you charge, the more powerful the attack will be, and the more energy it'll consume.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Kinetic Shotty</strong> - A double-barreled shotgun that draws from kinetic energy, with the ability to launch grenades.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shotty Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a wide spread of pellets. The faster Sonic's going, the more pellets will be fired, and the higher the damage output. If Sonic's in the air, the spread will be tighter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kinetic Grenade</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Launch a grenade that inherits Sonic's current momentum. The projectile can be kicked or Homing Attacked to become a homing projectile.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Shuriken Crossbow</strong> - A modified crossbow that fires shurikens at high speed.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shuriken Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a shuriken that tears through multiple enemies. Has a bit of a long cooldown.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V</strong> - An enhanced plasma rifle that has the ability to heal.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>Fire a stream of plasma. Fires in short bursts.</kbd></li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. V <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V can heal Sonic. It drains a <em>lot</em> of Chaos Energy, so use with care.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Rioter</strong> - A rocket launcher that can be rapidly fired.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rocket Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rocket. Deals more damage if fired while Sonic is in the air. The projectile can be kicked or Homing Attacked to become a homing projectile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Detonation</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rocket Rioter <br> Sonic will remotely make any rockets he fired explode.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=amy.png id=character />
            <h3>Amy Rose</h3>
            <p>Amy controls similarly to Sonic, but she can't move around in the air as easy as he can.</p>
            <p>Most of Amy's weapons are really strong, and can easily be used to take out enemies from afar.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Amy's kick is slower than Sonic's, and doesn't do much damage. It's more useful for getting enemies away from you, or provoking them so you can get a parry in. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Amy can jump mid-air.</li>
                <li><strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br> Amy can thrust herself downward and slam into the ground. Works as a low-range AoE attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> To get through tight spaces, press the <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> button to slide! Amy's Slide Dash will give her a sudden burst of speed, and have her height set to be low, so she can slide under gaps too small to pass through normally. She can also slide over gaps like in Crash 4. However, it does not deal damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> during Slide <br> Amy can jump during Slide to have her jump height boosted. If she jumps out of a slide while mid-air, it'll be treated as a normal jump, and she'll still be able to double jump afterwards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Piko Piko Hammer</strong> - Amy's signature weapon.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Piko Strike</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> Swing the Piko Piko Hammer forwards. It's quite powerful and has a small chance to crit enemies. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Quickly nullify all incoming damage, reflect projectiles and telekinetically attack hitscanning enemies. Any damage Amy normally takes while parrying instead withdraws from her Chaos Energy, and if she's out of Energy, attempts to parry won't protect her at all. Can be used to heal yourself in a pinch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hammer Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> at the exact moment the Piko Piko Hammer attacks <br> Jump a lot higher than a normal jump will take you, using the Piko Piko Hammer to boost Amy upwards.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Silent Rose</strong> - A silenced pistol.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silenced Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd><br> Fire a single bullet. Doesn't wake up enemies unless it hits them. Can be rapidly pressed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reload</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd><br> Reload the Silent Rose. Amy will reload by herself after firing 12 shots.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Precision Shotgun</strong> - A highly accurate shotgun with a precision scope.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shotgun Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a very tight spread of pellets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precise Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire an ultra-precise, concentrated shot. Can be cancelled if you let go of <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Railshot Cannon</strong> - A super powerful energy railgun.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Railshot Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire off a powerful railgun shot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zoom</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Zoom in. Has no effect on damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV</strong> - More powerful than the Mk. V, but uses more energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>Continuously fire plasma balls. Press <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> to kick and make the projectiles faster and more powerful. You don't need to hit the projectiles themselves, just kick the air. I don't know why either.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV can heal Amy. It heals slower than the Mk. V does, but uses a lot less Chaos Energy.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Missiles</strong> - A rapid-fire missile launcher.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three rockets in quick succession.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triple Launch</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three rockets simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <h3>Classic Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Classic Sonic is designed for people who prefer platforming, and don't necessarily want to focus on FPS combat that much.</p>
            <p>Classic's gunplay is as simple as it gets &ndash; shoot things until they die, and his weapons are simply turbo-charged DOOM weapons.</p>
            <p>He can't double jump, unlike everyone else, and he has a Bounce Attack instead of a Slam Attack.</p>
            <p>You could consider him SRB2 Sonic in Sonic: Lock &amp; Load.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> A quick rolling attack that inherits Sonic's momentum. If Sonic is standing still, his height won't change during Spin Attack. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> mid-air <br> Also known as the Insta-Shield. Sonic can perform a Spin Attack mid-air. This move will temporarily turn Sonic invincible. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Sonic Thok</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> or <kbd>Jump</kbd> after a jump</span><br> Sonic can thok, flinging himself forwards at high speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Bounce Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air</span><br> Works like the Slam Attack, but with no AoE attack, and Sonic will bounce upon landing.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing</strong> - Hold <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> while crouching <br> Sonic can focus his energy to heal himself up to 150 Rings. You'll be frozen in place while healing, and you'll take double damage if hit, so be careful.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unarmed</strong> - While unarmed, Sonic gains access to his Drift and Spin Dash abilities.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drift</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Sonic can skid across the floor at high speed, generating Chaos Energy. If he uses it in the air, it'll be a lot slower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> to charge, then release <br> <em>The</em> signature technique. Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Spin Dash to Spin Dash Jump, and you can hold <kbd>Move Back</kbd> to slow down the Spin Dash. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drop Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air until you hit the ground <br> An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wall Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> against a wall after jumping <br> An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Blaster</strong> - A plasma rifle with fast projectiles. Quite overpowered. Please nerf.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plasma Stream</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> Fire a stream of plasma projectiles.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - An automatic shotgun with a burst fire.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speedy Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rapid shotgun blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burst Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a quintuple burst fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Rain</strong> - A turbo-charged chaingun with a wide spread.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bullet Rain</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a barrage of incredibly inaccurate bullets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - A rapid fire rocket launcher that can be used for rocket jumping.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stream Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of rockets that launch targets far, including Sonic. Sonic takes less damage from his own rockets, so you can get away with rocket jumping.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <h3>Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Shadow nearly controls exactly the same as Sonic, but he can't jump off of walls, and has a completely different Homing Attack.</p>
            <p>His Chaos Snap gives him the ability to teleport around the level, so he can reach places or skip certain platforming sections he normally wouldn't be able to.</p>
            <p>His weapons are the most powerful in the game, but use up the most energy.</p>
            <p>Shadow's combat is a lot simpler than the rest of the cast, and doesn't have nearly as much depth as Sonic's, but he can typically get through most combat encounters easier than everyone else.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when close to a target <br> Shadow can destroy most enemies with a single punch. If he's in his Super Form, his punches will cause an explosion. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Spear</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Shadow can fire a Chaos Spear that can home in on targets. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Shadow can jump mid-air.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Snap</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> A less powerful Chaos Control that lets Shadow teleport. Can only be used twice mid-air. If Shadow is holding the Chaos Emerald, he'll gain an additional Chaos Snap. Shadow is invincible during this technique.</li>
                <li><strong>Homing Assault</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> when Homing Reticle appears <br> Shadow can quickly zoom to a target and attack it. Unlike Sonic's Homing Attack, Shadow will rebound afterwards. He'll also automatically be looking at the target he just Homing Assaulted, so he can combo the move.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Shovel</strong> - The ultimate symbol of respect. The High Shovel deals a powerful blow to whatever enemy Shadow hits with it. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shovel Smash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing the High Shovel forward and destroy anything unlucky enough to be in your way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Shadow zoom forward at high speed, similar to Sonic's version of the move. It starts up faster and can be held in mid-air, but Boost Jumping is less effective and Shadow descends quickly when using it in the air, kind of like in Sonic Forces.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Troll Slaiying Knife</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzEHKyUZp4&t=354s">They cant troll you if there dead!</a> The ultimate troll slaiying weapon, which deals enough damage to one-shot basically every enemy in the game. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ultimate Stab</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Strike with the Troll Slaiying Knife, which kills ANYTHING it touches.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-Machine Gun</strong> - An MP5. No, that's it. It has no special properties whatsoever.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Rapidly fire the SMG.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Dark Assaulter</strong> - An automatic shotgun. We really like those, huh?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assault Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire shotgun blasts.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Quartenary Decimator</strong> - A quad-barreled, super powerful shotgun with quite a bit of recoil.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decimation Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire an ungodly amount of pellets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Emerald</strong> - A Chaos Emerald replica capable of firing BFG projectiles. Automatically regenerates Chaos Energy. Once you have this weapon, you've pretty much won.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a BFG blast.</li>
