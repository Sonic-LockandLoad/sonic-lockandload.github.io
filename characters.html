            <h1>Characters, skills and weapons</h1>
            <p id="redquoteblock"><strong>Attention!</strong> This information is based on the latest Git development version of Sonic: Lock & Load v1.4 "Horizons". Some of the information here isn't going to be accurate when you compare it to the currently-very-outdated SAGE 2022 Final Final Demo.</p>
            <h3>Universal Skills</h3>
            <p>These following skills are shared by everyone, or mostly everyone (usually excluding Classic Sonic).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic, Amy and Shadow can jump mid-air, to extend their aerial
                    movement and gain extra height and distance. Classic Sonic instead has the <a href="#sonicthok">Sonic Thok</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic, Amy and Shadow can thrust themselves downward and slam
                    into the ground. Damages enemies in a low radius. Jump immediately after a Slam Attack to jump higher. Classic Sonic instead
                    has the <a href="#bounceattack">Bounce Attack</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crouch Slide</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> while moving <br> Crouch sliding is a movement technique available to
                    every character that lets you slide around on the ground. This preserves more momentum than moving without crouching,
                    and can be used to gain and maintain high ground speeds. Sonic, Amy and Classic Sonic can cancel a few of their
                    movement skills into crouch slide.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src=sonic.png id=character />
            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is the fastest character in Sonic: Lock & Load, with super high mobility and a multitude of ways to get around the environment, both on the ground and in the air.</p>
            <p>Sonic focuses mostly on super fast action, and his weapons are balanced around the high speeds he can reach.</p>
            <p>Out of the entire cast of the game, Sonic is the character with the highest skill ceiling and high-speed combo potential. He's also just the character that's the most developed, since, well. . . it <em>is</em> <strong>Sonic</strong>: Lock & Load.</p>
            <p>A lot of his weapons and movement skills can be tied together for high speed and fast action gameplay.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> 
                    Sonic's able to deliver a swift kick from his right foot at any time, dealing damage and knockback to any enemy he's
                    up close to, even if he's in the process of using a weapon.<br>
                    If Sonic's off the ground, his kick will deal double damage, and he'll swing from above rather than from the right.<br>
                    Can activate attackable switches. Becomes Homing Attack if the Homing Reticle is active.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Homing Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when Homing Reticle appears <br>
                    Sonic can perform a Homing Attack, launching himself towards a target and performing a lightning-fast kick, 
                    rebounding off of his target, which can be used for positioning himself for combos or mobility.<br>
                    If a Double Jump wasn't used, you can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> as soon as Sonic rebounds to rebound higher, 
                    which is extremely useful for mobility and positioning.<br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air, while next to a wall <br> 
                    Sonic can perform a Wall Jump, which makes him quickly grip onto a wall and immediately push himself off
                    of it, no matter what direction he's facing, even if the wall is behind him.<br>
                    This is primarily used for mobility, and some obstacles require its repeated use to scale opposing walls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quick Step</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> 
                    Sonic can quickly sidestep to avoid attacks or move fast quickly. A Quick Step will render Sonic invulnerable for
                    10 tics (just over a quarter of a second). Hold down any movement keys during a Quick Step to move in that direction.<br>
                    Can be cancelled into a jump or crouch slide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quick Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd>, <kbd>Crouch</kbd>, release <kbd>Crouch</kbd> <br>
                    An advanced technique. Similar to wavedashing in SSBM, Sonic can perform the Quick Dash by cancelling a Quick Step
                    into a crouch slide, then immediately cancelling the crouch slide and standing back up.<br>
                    If you chain multiple Quick Dashes together, it allows Sonic to move extremely fast in a short amount of time.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - The legendary sacred sword from a dimension of stories. Caliburn once assisted Sonic on his journey to stop King Arthur's reign of terror back when he was sent into the world of Arthurian legend.<br>Tails had managed to reverse-engineer the power of the book in order to bring Caliburn to Sonic's world, in the present timeline, and now he's along for the ride!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sword Slash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Swing Caliburn from side to side. Rapidly press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to perform a combo. Attacks in a wide radius,
                        but is fairly weak. Probably not a good idea to use for a tough enemy if you just go in swinging.
                        Does not trigger enemies' pain state. In the air, Sword Slash will make Sonic move forward a little bit, so
                        you can rapidly swing Caliburn to move forwards at high speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Boost Slash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> during Boost <br>
                        If Sonic swings Caliburn in the middle of performing the Boost, the attack will be a <strong>lot</strong> more
                        powerful than a standard Sword Slash. Damage scales depending on Boost speed, so you can combo an Accel Boost
                        into Boost Slash for maximum damage. Shares every other property with Sword Slash, and lets Sonic parry just
                        the same.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> when enemy attacks <br>
                        Up close to an enemy, attack with Caliburn within 0.2 seconds (6 <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Definitions
                        #Units_of_time">tics</a>) of an enemy's attack to parry it, turning the enemy's attack against itself, removing
                        over a third of its health and flinging them far away! Parrying only works on the first swing, and won't be active
                        during a Sword Slash combo.<br>
                        And remember, you have to be close enough to an enemy to parry its attacks!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Sonic zoom forward at high speed. The longer you hold, the
                        faster it'll go. If Sonic's already moving faster than his minimum Boost speed, it'll be inherited from his current
                        speed. Press <kbd>Jump</kbd> to perform a Boost Jump, which preserves the Boost's momentum and gives Sonic a height
                        boost. Cannot be held mid-air, unless you're Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accel Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> right after <kbd>Forward</kbd> <br> Accel Boost will make Sonic
                        blast off at his maximum Boost speed. This can be used to quickly zip to a far-away point, in case the regular initial
                        Boost speed isn't enough for you. Functionally identical to the Boost.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Pistol</strong> - A modified G.U.N. sidearm, retrieved by Sonic during a mission, and fixed up by Tails.<br>The weapon can be shifted to take advantage of the railgun module Tails had installed, allowing Sonic to charge up a shot that sends him flying back.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burst Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three bullets in quick succession. If Sonic is in the air, each bullet will do double damage. Can be spammed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recoil Burst</strong> - Charge with <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd>, press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to use <br> Charge a railgun blast, and then fire. The longer you charge, the more powerful the attack will be, and the more energy it'll consume. Recoil Burst will also send Sonic flying in the opposite direction he's facing, making it an excellent mobility tool. If followed up immediately with <kbd>Fire</kbd>, the cooldown will be skipped, allowing you to quickly combo into Burst Fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Kinetic Shotty</strong> - Built from parts from a destroyed Eggman robot, the Kinetic Shotty uses static electricity to fire a wide spread of Chaos Energy pellets, with the number of pellets increasing with the amount of power supplied, which is seemingly limitless. Tails had a grenade launcher addon installed, which taps into the same power source. Somehow, he managed to make the projectile look like a rocket. . .</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shotty Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a wide spread of pellets. The faster Sonic's going, the more pellets will be fired, and the higher the damage output. If Sonic's in the air, the spread will be tighter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kinetic Grenade</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Launch a grenade that inherits Sonic's current momentum. The projectile can be kicked or Homing Attacked to become a homing projectile. <strong>Autoaim really messes with this fire mode, you should probably turn it off.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Shuriken Crossbow</strong> - A crossbow given to Sonic by Espio.<br>It uses the power of magnetism to temporarily fuse the shuriken to the weapon's base, and the projectile is flung forward at high speed when the magnetic field is released.<br>The shuriken, made with Chaos Energy, is quite durable, and will tear through as many targets as are in its way.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shuriken Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a shuriken that tears through multiple enemies. Has a bit of a long cooldown.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V</strong> - A prototype energy weapon retrieved from G.U.N. which seems to have originated from the Space Colony ARK. The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V fires a stream of energy at its targets, but, being a prototype, it's susceptible to overheating. The Eclipse Blaster can resonate with the Chaos Energy present within Sonic and allow him to restore his Rings, but it uses quite a lot of his Energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>Fire a stream of plasma that deals continuous damage to enemies. The stream can be held down for up to three seconds before overheating, but it can cool down even if Sonic isn't holding it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. V <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V can heal Sonic. It drains a <em>lot</em> of Chaos Energy, so use with care.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Rioter</strong> - A rocket launcher ripped from an Eggman robot, with a quick loading mechanic that lets it fire rockets faster than a regular rocket launcher. It has a second trigger on it which allows any rockets in flight to be remotely detonated.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rocket Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rocket. Deals more damage if fired while Sonic is in the air. The projectile can be kicked or Homing Attacked to become a homing projectile.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Detonation</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rocket Rioter <br> Sonic will remotely make any rockets he fired explode.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=amy.png id=character />
            <h3>Amy Rose</h3>
            <p>Amy controls similarly to Sonic, but she can't move around in the air as easy as he can.</p>
            <p>Most of Amy's weapons are really strong, and can easily be used to take out enemies from afar.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Amy's kick is slower than Sonic's, and doesn't do much damage. It's more useful for getting enemies away from you, or provoking them so you can get a parry in. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> To get through tight spaces, press the <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> button to slide! Amy's Slide Dash will give her a sudden burst of speed, and have her height set to be low, so she can slide under gaps too small to pass through normally. She can also slide over gaps like in Crash 4. However, it does not deal damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> during Slide <br> Amy can jump during Slide to have her jump height boosted. If she jumps out of a slide while mid-air, it'll be treated as a normal jump, and she'll still be able to double jump afterwards. It's important to note that the Slide Jump must be performed while Amy is still in the slide animation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Piko Piko Hammer</strong> - Amy's signature weapon, which she's kept with her ever since 1998.<br>Amy has become quite proficient with the weapon, and is able to nullify and reflect any incoming attacks with a simple reverse spin, at the cost of some of her Chaos Energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Piko Strike</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing the Piko Piko Hammer forwards. It's quite powerful and has a small chance to crit enemies, but its wind-up animation makes it a little bit of a slow option. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Quickly nullify all incoming damage, reflect projectiles and telekinetically attack hitscanning enemies. Any damage Amy normally takes while parrying instead withdraws from her Chaos Energy, and if she's out of Energy, attempts to parry won't protect her at all. Can be used to heal yourself in a pinch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hammer Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> at the exact moment the Piko Piko Hammer attacks <br> Jump a lot higher than a normal jump will take you, using the Piko Piko Hammer to boost Amy upwards.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Silent Rose</strong> - A pistol Amy had retrieved from a G.U.N. outpost whilst she was on a mission. It had just been abandoned, so Amy thought it would be fine to keep it with her.<br>When she brought it back home, she painted the weapon pink and attached a silencer to it, so that it would help for her sneaking missions.<br>Especially since she REALLY wanted to one-up Rouge one day.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silenced Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd><br> Fire a single bullet. Doesn't wake up enemies unless it hits them. Can be rapidly pressed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reload</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd><br> Reload the Silent Rose. Amy will reload by herself after firing 12 shots.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Precision Shotgun</strong> - A highly accurate shotgun that had been given to Amy by Shadow, as he thought she would need it for a mission as big as this.<br>The delay between shots is rather small, so it'd work fine for fast action.<br>Amy is able to manifest a holographic scope while charging an ultra-precise shot, at the cost of a rather large amount of Chaos Energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shotgun Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a very tight spread of pellets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precise Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire an ultra-precise, concentrated shot. Can be cancelled if you let go of <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Railshot Cannon</strong> - A custom-built railgun Tails had built at the request of Amy. It's devastatingly powerful, but it uses a third of Amy's total Chaos Energy, therefore, Tails had advised her to keep its usage to a minimum.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Railshot Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire off a powerful railgun shot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zoom</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Zoom in. Has no effect on damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV</strong> - An even earlier prototype of the Eclipse Blaster weapon G.U.N had retrieved from ARK.<br>This version did not have a cooldown, but it fired much slower and was not very energy-efficient.<br>However, it does not use much Energy when restoring its user's Rings.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>Continuously fire plasma balls. Press <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> to kick and make the projectiles faster and more powerful. You don't need to hit the projectiles themselves, just kick the air. I don't know why either.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV can heal Amy. It heals slower than the Mk. V does, but uses a lot less Chaos Energy.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Missiles</strong> - Ripped from the same robot that Sonic got his Rocket Rioter from. This missile launcher, on the opposite arm, could fire small missiles at a rapid rate, and three missiles can be fired simultaneously. Amy prefers this weapon, since it's much more useful at long range.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three rockets in quick succession.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triple Launch</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three rockets simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <h3>Classic Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Classic Sonic is designed for people who prefer platforming, and don't necessarily want to focus on FPS combat that much.</p>
            <p>Classic's gunplay is as simple as it gets &ndash; shoot things until they die, and his weapons are simply turbo-charged DOOM weapons.</p>
            <p>He can't double jump, unlike everyone else, and he has a Bounce Attack instead of a Slam Attack.</p>
            <p>You could consider him SRB2 Sonic in Sonic: Lock &amp; Load.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> A quick rolling attack that inherits Sonic's momentum. If Sonic is standing still, his height won't change during Spin Attack. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> mid-air <br> Also known as the Insta-Shield. Sonic can perform a Spin Attack mid-air. This move will temporarily turn Sonic invincible. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li id="sonicthok"><strong>Sonic Thok</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> or <kbd>Jump</kbd> after a jump</span><br> Similar to its Sonic Robo Blast 2 counterpart, Sonic Thok will fling Sonic forward at high speed. When Sonic performs this technique, he will move forward in a straight line, regardless of the direction he is facing.</li>
                <li id="bounceattack"><strong>Bounce Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air</span><br> Sonic performs a downward attack similar to the Slam Attack. He will bounce upon landing, which can be used to reach higher platforms, and it won't damage enemies in a radius like the Slam Attack does.</li>
                <li><strong>Healing</strong> - Hold <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> while crouching <br> Sonic can focus his energy to heal himself up to 150 Rings. You'll be frozen in place while healing, and you'll take double damage if hit, so be careful.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unarmed</strong> - No explanation needed. While unarmed, Sonic gains access to his Drift and Spin Dash abilities.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drift</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Sonic can skid across the floor at high speed, generating Chaos Energy. If he uses it in the air, it'll be a lot slower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> to charge, then release <br> <em>The</em> signature technique. Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Spin Dash to Spin Dash Jump, and you can hold <kbd>Move Back</kbd> to slow down the Spin Dash. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drop Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air until you hit the ground <br> An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wall Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> against a wall to charge, then release <br> Sonic can rev up a wallbound Spin Dash and release it, sending himself flying up. This technique can be used to scale walls, and is a replacement for his Modern counterpart's Wall Jump.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Blaster</strong> - An attempt to recreate the Eclipse Blaster by Tails. It's very ammo-efficient, but Tails had not been able to replicate its Ring-restoring feature.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plasma Stream</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of plasma projectiles.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - A powerful shotgun Classic Sonic had found on a mysterious marine base on Mars in an alternate dimension. Classic Sonic had brought it to Modern Sonic's world so that Tails could make it rapid fire, which he was more than happy to do, even adding a burst fire option for extra power.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speedy Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rapid shotgun blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burst Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a quintuple burst fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Rain</strong> - Classic Sonic had found a chaingun on board the same military base he had found that shotgun; and again, he had asked Tails to make it fire faster. As a side effect, the weapon no longer creates any muzzle flashes.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bullet Rain</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a barrage of incredibly inaccurate bullets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - This rocket launcher came from the same alternate-dimension military base the Speedy Shotgun and Chaos Rain had originated from &ndash; and Classic Sonic had once again asked for it to fire faster. Tails had modified the weapon's projectiles to resonate with Classic Sonic's natural Chaos Energy, and as a result, the hedgehog takes less self-damage.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stream Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of rockets that launch targets far, including Sonic. Sonic takes less damage from his own rockets, so you can get away with rocket jumping.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <h3>Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Shadow nearly controls exactly the same as Sonic, but where he differs are the abilities available to him - he can't Quick Step or Wall Jump, and his Homing Attack is a Homing Assault, which works and controls quite a bit differently.</p>
            <p>His Chaos Snap gives him the ability to quickly dash around the level, so he can reach places or skip certain platforming sections he normally wouldn't be able to.</p>
            <p>His weapons are the most powerful in the game, but they can't be comboed as well as Sonic's can; they're quite basic.</p>
            <p>Shadow's combat is a lot simpler than the rest of the cast, and doesn't have nearly as much depth as Sonic's combat, but he can typically get through most combat encounters easier than everyone else.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when close to a target <br> Shadow can destroy most enemies with a single punch. If he's in his Super Form, his punches will cause an explosion. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Spear</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Shadow can fire a Chaos Spear that can home in on targets. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Snap</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> A less powerful Chaos Control that lets Shadow teleport. Can only be used twice mid-air. If Shadow is holding the Chaos Emerald, he'll gain an additional Chaos Snap. Shadow is invincible during this technique.</li>
                <li><strong>Homing Assault</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> when Homing Reticle appears <br> Shadow can quickly zoom to a target and attack it. Unlike Sonic's Homing Attack, Shadow will immediately teleport to his target instead of dashing towards it. He'll also automatically be looking at the target he just Homing Assaulted after rebounding, so he can very easily combo the move.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Shovel</strong> - A rather tall shovel that Shadow owns, given to him by Knuckles, who owns an identical one. Whenever Shadow heads out with Knuckles to deal with a problem involving an annoying adversary that deserves to be buried in the ground, he takes the shovel with him. Afterwards, the hedgehog and echidna typically perform a 'high shovel', in which they hit their shovels together in celebration.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shovel Smash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing the High Shovel forward and destroy anything unlucky enough to be in your way. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Shadow zoom forward at high speed, similar to Sonic's version of the move. It starts up faster and can be held in mid-air, but Boost Jumping is less effective and Shadow descends quickly when using it in the air, kind of like in Sonic Forces.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Troll Slaiying Knife</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzEHKyUZp4&t=354s">They cant troll you if there dead!</a> The ultimate troll slaiying weapon, which deals enough damage to one-shot basically every enemy in the game.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ultimate Stab</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Strike with the Troll Slaiying Knife, which kills ANYTHING it touches. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-Machine Gun</strong> - The standard-issue G.U.N. assault weapon, which Shadow carries to any and all missions, even if he doesn't need to use it. He even built a holster on his Dark Rider motorcycle for it. . .</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Rapidly fire the SMG.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Dark Assaulter</strong> - An assault shotgun, taken from G.U.N.'s armory. Shadow had convinced his superiors it would help him on his mission.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assault Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire shotgun blasts.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Quartenary Decimator</strong> - A rather terrifying-looking four-barreled weapon that Shadow had retrieved from a high-security enemy base. Technically speaking, it's the property of G.U.N., but Shadow's the only one who even has the courage to use the thing. Its pellet spread and high recoil is insane, and every other G.U.N. agent is afraid of <em>literally</em> shooting themselves in the foot.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decimation Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire an ungodly amount of pellets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Emerald</strong> - A Chaos Emerald replica Shadow had built using stolen Eggman tech, motivated by his determination to harness the Chaos Emeralds' power. It harnesses and rapidly supplies Chaos Energy, and Shadow can fire an incredibly powerful blast, which subtracts a lot of his Chaos Energy, but the weapon regenerates itself, so it's not so bad.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a BFG blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Chaos Emerald <br> The Chaos Emerald replica can heal Shadow, and heals a lot faster than Sonic's Eclipse Blaster Mk. V does.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Dual Assimilator</strong> - Ripped right off of an enormous turret from an Eggman base, this weapon fires two homing rockets that deal so much devastation, it could kill its wielder in a single hit if they were anywhere close to the blast radius. Shadow has to constantly remind himself not to use it for propelling himself in the air.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire two auto-targeted missiles. DO NOT FIRE THIS AT A CLOSE RANGE. Actually, just don't use this fire mode if you're near any enemies you're not facing towards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Untargeted Launch</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire two non-targeted missiles that just go straight forward. Can still absolutely destroy you if you aren't careful.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
