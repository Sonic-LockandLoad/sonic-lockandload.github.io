            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is the fastest character in Sonic: Lock & Load, balanced between combat and platforming. He's designed to be accessible to first time players, but he also has a high skill ceiling for more skilled players.</p>
            <p>Sonic focuses mostly on fast FPS action, having weapons that aren't that powerful alone, but are designed to be used in tandem, for weapon combos. His movement abilities are pretty powerful, but uncontrollable if you don't know how to use him.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - The Sacred Sword. Hits multiple times in a single swing, which can stunlock enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Pistol</strong> - A rapid-fire pistol crossed with a railgun.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Shotty</strong> - An automatic shotgun with an adjustable spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Shuriken Crossbow</strong> - A modified crossbow that fires shurikens at high speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V</strong> - An enhanced plasma rifle that has the ability to heal.</li>
                <li><strong>Rocket Rioter</strong> - A rocket launcher that can be rapidly fired. Deals more damage if Sonic fired the rocket while mid-air.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand</kbd> <br> Sonic can kick enemies at any time. Damage is doubled if Sonic is mid-air. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Caliburn <br> Sonic can Boost while holding Caliburn to zoom around the place. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Boost to Boost Jump. The Boost gets faster depending on how long it's held, which also increases Boost Jump height. To Boost Jump somewhere high, find an open space, continuously Boost to build up speed, then look towards where you want to go and hit <kbd>Jump</kbd> to perform the Boost Jump.</li>
                <li><strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> when facing wall <br> Sonic can jump off of walls to gain extra height and distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can jump mid-air. Wall jumping will give him a free double jump. If Sonic is underwater, he can jump infinite times.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> + <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Sonic can thrust himself downward with Caliburn and slam into the ground. Works as a low-range AoE attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Recoil Burst</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Accelerated Pistol <br> Sonic can use the railgun fire mode of his Accelerated Pistol to be sent flying backwards. Can be used to gain extra height.</li>
                <li><strong>Force Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rapid Shotty <br> Similar to Recoil Burst, using the Rapid Shotty's tight spread fire mode instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. V <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V can heal Sonic.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Detonation</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rocket Rioter <br> Sonic will remotely make any rockets he fired explode.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src=amy.png id=character />
            <h3>Amy Rose</h3>
            <p>Amy is slower than everyone else, but she has the most control over her movement, making platforming sections easier than either of the Sonics.</p>
            <p>In combat, she takes increased damage, so prioritising defence or evading attacks is important.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Piko Piko Hammer</strong> - Amy's signature weapon. Has a small crit chance. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Silent Rose</strong> - A silenced pistol. Doesn't wake up enemies unless it hits them, so it's good for taking out smaller enemies from afar.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision Shotgun</strong> - A highly accurate shotgun with a precision scope.</li>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV</strong> - More powerful than the Mk. V, but uses more energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Missiles</strong> - A rapid-fire missile launcher.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand</kbd> <br> Amy's kick is slower than Sonic's, and doesn't do much damage. It's more useful for getting enemies away from you. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Amy can jump mid-air. Unlike with Sonic, the double jump is typically needed to jump longer gaps that Sonic can easily cross with a single jump.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guard</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Piko Piko Hammer <br> Amy can guard using her Piko Piko Hammer.</li>
                <li><strong>Hammer Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> at the exact moment the Piko Piko Hammer attacks <br> Hammer Jumping will thrust Amy upward by a great height. </li>
                <li><strong>Hammer Glide</strong> - Continue holding <kbd>Fire</kbd> + any movement keys during Hammer Jump <br> Amy's horizontal speed will be increased during a Hammer Glide. Experienced players can take advantage of this.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Precision Shotgun <br> Amy can fire an ultra-precise, concentrated shot. Can be cancelled if you let go of <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV can heal Amy. It heals slower than the Mk. V does.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <h3>Classic Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Classic Sonic is designed for people who prefer platforming, and don't necessarily want to focus on FPS combat that much.</p>
            <p>His abilities aren't nearly as broken as any of the other characters' abilities, so he focuses more on fundamental platforming using his abilities to assist him, and his weapons are simply faster classic DOOM weapons.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Blaster</strong> - A plasma rifle with fast projectiles. Quite overpowered. Please nerf.</li>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - An automatic shotgun with a burst fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Rain</strong> - A turbo-charged chaingun with a wide spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - A rapid fire rocket launcher that can be used for rocket jumping.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Yes. Sonic can punch enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Sonic Thok</strong> - <kbd>Offhand</kbd> + optionally any movement keys <br> Sonic can thok, flinging himself forwards at high speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Drift</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Sonic can skid across the floor at high speed, generating Chaos Energy. If he uses it in the air, it'll be a lot slower.</li>
                <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> and <kbd>Crouch</kbd> to charge, then release<br> <em>The</em> signature technique. Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Spin Dash to Spin Dash Jump, and you can hold <kbd>Move Back</kbd> to slow down the Spin Dash. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Burst Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Speedy Shotgun <br> A quintuple burst fire.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <h3>Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Shadow has the same base speed as Sonic, and a jump height higher than everyone else's.</p>
            <p>His Chaos Snap gives him the ability to teleport around the level, so he can reach places or skip certain platforming sections he normally wouldn't be able to. <br> His weapons are the most powerful in the game, but use up the most energy. Shadow's combat is a <em>lot</em> simpler than the rest of the cast, and doesn't have nearly as much depth as Sonic's, but he can typically get through most combat encounters easier than everyone else.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Shovel</strong> - The ultimate symbol of respect. The High Shovel deals a powerful blow to whatever enemy Shadow hits with it. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Troll Slaiying Knife</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzEHKyUZp4&t=354s">They cant troll you if there dead!</a> The ultimate troll slaiying weapon, which deals enough damage to one-shot basically every enemy in the game. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Assaulter</strong> - An automatic shotgun. We really like those, huh?</li>
                <li><strong>Quartenary Decimator</strong> - A quad-barreled, super powerful shotgun with quite a bit of recoil.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Emerald</strong> - A Chaos Emerald replica capable of firing BFG projectiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Assimilator</strong> - A dual rocket launcher with homing rockets that can NOT be used for rocket jumping. Don't even try. Please.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Shadow can destroy most enemies with a single punch. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Spear</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> While unarmed, Shadow can fire a Chaos Spear that homes in on targets. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Chaos Emerald <br> The Chaos Emerald replica can heal Shadow, and heals a lot faster than Sonic's Eclipse Blaster Mk. V does.</li>
            </ul>
