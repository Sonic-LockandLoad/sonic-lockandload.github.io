            <img src=sonic.png id=character />
            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is the fastest character in Sonic: Lock & Load, balanced between combat and platforming. He's designed to be accessible to first time players, but he also has a high skill ceiling for more skilled players.</p>
            <p>Sonic focuses mostly on fast FPS action, having weapons that aren't that powerful alone, but are designed to be used in tandem, for weapon combos. His movement abilities are pretty powerful, but uncontrollable if you don't know how to use him.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - The Sacred Sword. Hits multiple times in a single swing, which can stunlock enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Pistol</strong> - A rapid-fire pistol crossed with a railgun.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Shotty</strong> - An automatic shotgun with an adjustable spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Shuriken Crossbow</strong> - A modified crossbow that fires shurikens at high speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V</strong> - An enhanced plasma rifle that has the ability to heal. Fires in short bursts <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Rocket Rioter</strong> - A rocket launcher that can be rapidly fired. Deals more damage if Sonic fired the rocket while mid-air.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Offhand</kbd> before v1.4)</span> <br> Sonic can kick enemies at any time. Damage is doubled if Sonic is mid-air. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Caliburn <br> Sonic can Boost while holding Caliburn to zoom around the place. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Boost to Boost Jump. Sonic cannot continuously Boost mid-air <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span>, so make sure you know where you're going before you start speeding off.</li>
                <li><strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> when facing wall <br> Sonic can jump off of walls to gain extra height and distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can jump mid-air. Wall jumping will give him a free double jump.</li>
                <li><strong>Homing Snap</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> Homing Snap allows Sonic to home in on any attackable target if he's not too far away. As long as you keep looking at the target, Sonic will be suspended mid-air for a couple of seconds. <br> You can follow up by attacking with a kick by pressing <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd>, or pressing <kbd>Jump</kbd> to escape. <br> By default, a reticle will appear whenever you're looking at a target you can Homing Snap to while Sonic is in the air. This can be changed to be always shown or not shown at all.</li>
                <li><strong>Soul Surge</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> with Caliburn, then <kbd>Fire</kbd> when blade glows white <br> The Soul Surge is back and better than ever! During a Homing Snap, while holding Caliburn, Sonic will be able to attack with an extra-powerful strike that destroys any single enemy. You have to attack with the right timing, so make sure you don't mess it up! Unlike in SatBK, you won't be able to use it consecutively. Costs 400 Chaos Energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Step</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> + <kbd>Strafe Left</kbd> or <kbd>Strafe Right</kbd> <br> Sonic can quickly sidestep at any time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Slam</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Crouch</kbd> with Caliburn mid-air <br> Sonic can thrust himself downward with Caliburn and slam into the ground. Works as a low-range AoE attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Recoil Burst</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Accelerated Pistol <br> Sonic can use the railgun fire mode of his Accelerated Pistol to be sent flying backwards. Can be used to gain extra height.</li>
                <li><strong>Force Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rapid Shotty <br> Similar to Recoil Burst, using the Rapid Shotty's tight spread fire mode instead. Can be used twice in quick succession <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. V <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V can heal Sonic.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Detonation</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rocket Rioter <br> Sonic will remotely make any rockets he fired explode.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src=amy.png id=character />
            <h3>Amy Rose</h3>
            <p>Amy is slower than everyone else, but she has the most control over her movement, making platforming sections easier than either of the Sonics. In combat, she takes increased damage from enemy attacks, so avoiding damage is important.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Piko Piko Hammer</strong> - Amy's signature weapon. Has a small crit chance. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Silent Rose</strong> - A silenced pistol. Doesn't wake up enemies unless it hits them.</li>
                <li><strong>Precision Shotgun</strong> - A highly accurate shotgun with a precision scope.</li>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV</strong> - More powerful than the Mk. V, but uses more energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Missiles</strong> - A rapid-fire missile launcher.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Offhand</kbd> before v1.4)</span> <br> Amy's kick is slower than Sonic's, and doesn't do much damage. It's more useful for getting enemies away from you. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br> Amy can jump mid-air. Unlike with Sonic, the double jump is typically needed to jump longer gaps that Sonic can easily cross with a single jump.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> To get through tight spaces, press the <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> button to slide! Amy's Slide will give her a sudden burst of speed, and have her height set to be low, so she can slide under gaps too small to pass through normally. She can also slide over gaps like in Crash 4. However, it does not deal damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide Jump</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> during Slide <br> Amy can jump during Slide to have her speed and height boosted. If she jumps out of a slide while mid-air, it'll be treated as a normal jump, and she'll still be able to double jump afterwards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guard</strong> <span style="color:red">(removed in v1.4)</span> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Piko Piko Hammer <br> Amy can guard using her Piko Piko Hammer.</li>
                <li><strong>Parry</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Piko Piko Hammer <br> Amy can quickly nullify all incoming damage using her Piko Piko Hammer. If she's hit mid-parry, she'll lose Chaos Energy instead of Rings.</li>
                <li><strong>Hammer Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> immediately after <kbd>Fire</kbd> with Piko Piko Hammer <br> Hammer Jumping boosts Amy's jump height. </li>
                <li><strong>Hammer Glide</strong> - Continue holding <kbd>Fire</kbd> + any movement keys during Hammer Jump <br> Amy's horizontal speed will be increased during a Hammer Glide. Experienced players can take advantage of this.</li>
                <li><strong>Precise Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Precision Shotgun <br> Amy can fire an ultra-precise, concentrated shot. Can be cancelled if you let go of <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV can heal Amy. It heals slower than the Mk. V does.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <h3>Classic Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Classic Sonic is designed for people who prefer platforming, and don't necessarily want to focus on FPS combat that much.</p>
            <p>His abilities aren't nearly as broken as any of the other characters' abilities, so he focuses more on fundamental platforming using his abilities to assist him, and his weapons are simply faster classic DOOM weapons.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Blaster</strong> - A plasma rifle with fast projectiles. Quite overpowered. Please nerf.</li>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - An automatic shotgun with a burst fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Rain</strong> - A turbo-charged chaingun with a wide spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - A rapid fire rocket launcher that can be used for rocket jumping.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> <span style="color:red">(removed in v1.4)</span> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Yes. Sonic can punch enemies. <span style="color:red">Well, he could.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Spin Attack</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> A quick rolling attack. If Sonic is standing still, his height won't change during Spin Attack. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Insta-Shield</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> mid-air <br> Sonic can perform a Spin Attack mid-air. This move will temporarily turn Sonic invincible, and give him a short hop. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Sonic Thok</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Offhand</kbd> before v1.4)</span> + optionally any movement keys <br> Sonic can thok, flinging himself in any direction. Someone say SRB2?</li>
                <li><strong>Drift</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Sonic can skid across the floor at high speed, generating Chaos Energy. If he uses it in the air, it'll be a lot slower.</li>
                <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> to charge, then release <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Fire</kbd>+<kbd>Crouch</kbd> before v1.4)</span> <br> <em>The</em> signature technique. Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny. You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Spin Dash to Spin Dash Jump, and you can hold <kbd>Move Back</kbd> to slow down the Spin Dash. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Drop Dash</strong> <span style="color:red">(v1.4 only)</span> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air until you hit the ground <br> An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapon Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Burst Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Speedy Shotgun <br> A quintuple burst fire.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <h3>Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Shadow has the same base speed as Sonic, and a jump height higher than everyone else's. His Chaos Snap gives him the ability to teleport around the level, so he can reach places or skip certain platforming sections he normally wouldn't be able to. His weapons are the most powerful in the game, but use up the most energy. Shadow's combat is a <em>lot</em> simpler than the rest of the cast, and doesn't have nearly as much depth as Sonic's, but he can typically get through most combat encounters easier than everyone else.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Shovel</strong> - The ultimate symbol of respect. The High Shovel deals a powerful blow to whatever enemy Shadow hits with it. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Troll Slaiying Knife</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzEHKyUZp4&t=354s">They cant troll you if there dead!</a> The ultimate troll slaiying weapon, which deals enough damage to one-shot basically every enemy in the game. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Assaulter</strong> - An automatic shotgun. We really like those, huh?</li>
                <li><strong>Quartenary Decimator</strong> - A quad-barreled, super powerful shotgun with quite a bit of recoil.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Emerald</strong> - A Chaos Emerald replica capable of firing BFG projectiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Assimilator</strong> - A dual rocket launcher that can NOT be used for rocket jumping. Don't even try. Please.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Skills and Abilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> unarmed <br> Shadow can destroy most enemies with a single punch. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Snap</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Offhand</kbd> before v1.4)</span> <br> A less powerful Chaos Control that lets Shadow teleport. Can only be used twice mid-air.</li>
                <li><strong>Chaos Spear</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <span style="color:red">(<kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> unarmed before v1.4)</span> <br> While unarmed, Shadow can fire a Chaos Spear that homes in on targets. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Chaos Emerald <br> The Chaos Emerald replica can heal Shadow, and heals a lot faster than Sonic's Eclipse Blaster Mk. V does.</li>
            </ul>
