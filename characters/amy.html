            <h1>Amy Rose</h1>
            <img src=amy.png id=character />
            <p>VA: Lisa Ortiz</p>
            <p>Amy is the secondary face of Sonic: Lock &amp; Load - having been around since v0.8, the Rose Update, named after her.</p>
            <p>While Sonic is much more suited to aerial movement and travelling at high speeds, Amy is more suited for grounded movement and more precise, long-range combat - she's the Halo to Sonic's DOOM.</p>
            <p>Most of Amy's weapons are the strongest amongst the cast, and can effectively be used to take out enemies from afar. While she isn't nearly as stylish as Sonic is, she's great fun to play and master in her own right.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Amy can jump while she's already mid-air, to extend his aerial movement and gain extra height and distance.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air, while next to a wall <br> 
                    Amy can perform a wall jump, which causes her to push herself off of it, no matter what direction she's facing, even if she isn't facing the wall.<br>
                    This is primarily used for mobility, and some obstacles require its repeated use to scale opposing walls.<br>
                    Wall jumping also restores Amy's double jump.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Amy can thrust herself downward and slam into the ground. This technique damages and launches enemies in a low radius. Jump immediately after a Slam Attack to jump higher. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crouch Slide</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> while moving <br> 
                    Crouch sliding allows Amy to glide across the ground, boosting her speed.<br>
                    Jumping during a Crouch Slide increases Amy's jump distance based on his velocity.<br>
                    It's excellent for maintaining momentum and achieving high ground speeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slide Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br>
                    To get through tight spaces, press the <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> button to slide! <br>
                    Amy's Slide Dash will give her a sudden burst of speed, and have her height set to be low, so she can slide under gaps too small to pass through normally.
                    She can also slide over gaps, similar to Crash in Crash Bandicoot 4. <br>
                    However, it does not deal damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slide Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> during Slide <br>
                    Amy can jump during Slide Dash to jump much further than a standard jump. <br>
                    If she jumps out of a slide while mid-air, it'll be treated as a normal jump, and she'll still be able to double jump afterwards. <br>
                    It's important to note that the Slide Jump must be performed while Amy is still in the slide animation, otherwise it'll just be a normal or double jump.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br>
                    Amy's kick is slower than Sonic's, and doesn't do much damage. <br>
                    It's more useful for getting enemies away from you, or provoking them so you can get a parry in. <br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Piko Piko Hammer</strong> - Amy's signature weapon, which she's kept with her ever since 1998.<br>
                    Amy has become quite proficient with the weapon, and is able to nullify and reflect any incoming attacks with a simple reverse spin, at the cost of some of her Chaos Energy.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Piko Strike</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> on ground <br>
                        Swing the Piko Piko Hammer forwards. <br>
                        It's quite powerful and has a small chance to crit enemies, but its wind-up animation makes it a little bit of a slow option. <br>
                        Can activate attackable switches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Piko Revolve</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air <br>
                        Spin the Piko Piko Hammer around while boosting Amy's velocity forward. <br>
                        Shares every other property with Piko Strike.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homing Swing</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air when Homing Reticle appears <br>
                        An improvised version of the Homing Attack, utilising the momentum of Piko Revolve. <br>
                        When targetting an enemy while she's airborne, when Amy spins around her hammer, she'll automatically dash right for the target and attack it, in a similar fashion to the Homing Attack. <br>
                        One could consider it a targeted variant of Piko Revolve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Quickly nullify all incoming damage, reflect projectiles and telekinetically attack hitscanning enemies. <br>
                        Any damage Amy normally takes while parrying instead withdraws from her Chaos Energy, and if she's out of Energy, the parry window is much tighter and the move won't deal damage to enemies. <br>
                        Can be used to heal yourself in a pinch. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Hammer Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> at the end of Piko Strike <br>
                        Jump a lot higher than a normal jump will take you, using the Piko Piko Hammer to boost Amy upwards. <br>
                        The move requires timing, but the window is lenient enough.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Silent Rose</strong> - A pistol Amy had retrieved from a G.U.N. outpost.<br>
                    It had just been abandoned, so Amy thought it would be fine to keep it with her.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Silenced Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Fire a single bullet. Doesn't wake up enemies unless it hits them. Can be rapidly pressed, but needs to reload after 12 shots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reload</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Reload the Silent Rose. Amy will reload by herself after firing 12 shots.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li><strong>Precision Shotgun</strong> - A highly accurate shotgun that had been given to Amy by Shadow.<br>The delay between shots is rather small, so it'd work fine for fast action.<br>Amy is able to manifest a holographic scope while charging an ultra-precise shot, at the cost of a rather large amount of Chaos Energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Shotgun Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Fire a very tight spread of pellets, suitable for mid-to-long range combat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Precise Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> while holding <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Fire an ultra-precise, concentrated shot. Can be cancelled if you let go of <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> instead of pressing <kbd>Fire</kbd>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Railshot Cannon</strong> - A custom-built railgun Tails had built at the request of Amy.<br>
                    It's devastatingly powerful, but it uses a third of Amy's total Chaos Energy.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Railshot Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Fire off a powerful railgun shot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Zoom</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Zoom in. Has no effect on damage, is more useful for seeing far away.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV</strong> - An earlier prototype of the Eclipse Blaster that G.U.N had retrieved from ARK.<br>
                    This version did not have a cooldown, but it fired much slower and was not very energy-efficient.<br>
                    However, it does not use much Energy when restoring its user's Rings.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Continuously fire plasma balls. Press <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> to kick and make the projectiles faster and more powerful. <br>
                        You don't need to hit the projectiles themselves, just kick the air. I don't know why either.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br>
                        The Eclipse Blaster Mk. IV can heal Amy. It heals slower than Sonic's Mk. V does, but uses a lot less Chaos Energy.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>Rapid Missiles</strong> - Ripped from the same robot that Sonic got his Rocket Rioter from.<br>
                    This missile launcher, on the opposite arm, could fire small missiles at a rapid rate, and three missiles can be fired simultaneously. <br>
                    It's much more accurate than Sonic's Rocket Rioter, but it's not as powerful.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rapid Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Fire three rockets in quick succession.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Triple Launch</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br>
                        Fire three rockets simultaneously.
                    </li>
