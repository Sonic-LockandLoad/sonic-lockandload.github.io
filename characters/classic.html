            <h1>Sonic the Hedgehog (Classic)</h1>
            <img src=classic.png id=character />
            <p>VA: Ryan Drummond</p>
            <p>The younger counterpart of Sonic the Hedgehog, Classic Sonic represents the pre-v1.0 era of Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, reflected in his distinctive simplified weapon set and limited movement capabilities.</p>
            <p>Classic Sonic focuses mostly on providing a simple experience with an emphasis on skillful platforming, with inspiration from Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Robo Blast 2.</p>
            <p>Out of everyone, Classic Sonic has the steepest learning curve, since he lacks essential movement skills such as the double jump and wall jump.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sonic Thok</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> or <kbd>Jump</kbd> after a jump</span> <br>
                    Similar to its Sonic Robo Blast 2 counterpart, Sonic Thok will fling Sonic forward at high speed. <br>
                    The move can be aimed by holding a movement key before performing the move.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crouch Slide</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> while moving <br> 
                    Crouch sliding allows Sonic to glide across the ground, boosting his speed.<br>
                    Jumping during a Crouch Slide increases Sonic's jump distance based on his velocity.<br>
                    It's excellent for maintaining momentum and achieving high ground speeds.<br>
                    Crouch sliding is particularly useful when using it to cancel Sonic's other movement skills.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br>
                    A quick rolling attack that inherits Sonic's momentum. <br>
                    If Sonic is standing still, his height won't change during Spin Attack. <br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double Spin Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Also known as the Insta-Shield. <br>
                    Sonic can perform a Spin Attack mid-air. This move will temporarily turn Sonic invincible and can parry attacks. <br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bounce Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air</span> <br> 
                    Sonic performs a downward attack similar to the Slam Attack. <br>
                    He will bounce upon landing, which can be used to reach higher platforms, and it won't damage enemies in a radius like the Slam Attack does.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Healing</strong> - Hold <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> while crouching <br>
                    Sonic can focus his energy to heal himself up to 150 Rings. <br>
                    You'll be frozen in place while healing, and you'll take double damage if hit, so be careful.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unarmed</strong> - While unarmed, Sonic gains access to his Rush State and Spin Dash abilities.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rush State</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> + <kbd>Forward</kbd> unarmed <br>
                        Rush State will have Sonic rapidly move forwards and generate Chaos Energy. <br>
                        If Rush State is used in the air, it won't travel as far. Sonic also can't enter Rush State unless he's touching the ground. Does not deal damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Spin Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> to charge, then release <br>
                        Sonic's signature technique. Sonic can charge up a high-speed spin attack and send himself barrelling towards any enemy who ever looked at him funny. <br>
                        You can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> during a Spin Dash to Spin Dash Jump, and you can hold <kbd>Move Back</kbd> to slow down the Spin Dash. <br>
                        Can activate attackable switches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Drop Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air until you hit the ground <br>
                        An instant Spin Dash charged in the air. <br>
                        It isn't able to travel as fast as the Spin Dash does, but otherwise it has the exact same properties as the Spin Dash.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wall Dash</strong> - Hold <kbd>Fire</kbd> against a wall to charge, then release <br>
                        Sonic can rev up a wallbound Spin Dash and release it, sending himself flying up. <br>
                        This technique can be used to scale walls, and is a replacement for the Wall Jump. <br>
                        Press <kbd>Jump</kbd> to cancel the Wall Dash with a jump.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Blaster</strong> - An attempt to recreate the Eclipse Blaster by Tails.<br>It's very ammo-efficient, but Tails had not been able to replicate its Ring-restoring feature.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plasma Stream</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of plasma projectiles.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - A powerful shotgun Sonic had found on a mysterious marine base on Mars in an alternate dimension.<br>Sonic had brought it into the future (somehow) so that Tails could make it rapid fire, which he was more than happy to do, even adding a burst fire option for extra power.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speedy Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rapid shotgun blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burst Shot</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a quintuple burst fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Rain</strong> - Sonic had found a chaingun on board the same military base he had found that shotgun. Again, he had asked Tails to make it fire faster. As a side effect, the weapon no longer creates any muzzle flashes.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bullet Rain</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a barrage of incredibly inaccurate bullets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - This rocket launcher came from the same alternate-dimension military base the Speedy Shotgun and Chaos Rain had originated from &ndash; and Sonic had once again asked for it to fire faster. Tails had modified the weapon's projectiles to resonate with Sonic's natural Chaos Energy, and as a result, the hedgehog takes less self-damage.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stream Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of rockets that launch targets far, including Sonic. Sonic takes less damage from his own rockets, so you can get away with rocket jumping.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
