            <h1>Shadow the Hedgehog</h1>
            <img src=shadow.png id=character />
            <p>VA: Jason Griffith</p>
            <p>Shadow, being Sonic's equal in almost every way, controls very similarly to the blue hedgehog.</p>
            <p>While Sonic focuses on rapid stylish action, Shadow focuses on being overpowering and dominating the battlefield through calmer, more powerful attacks. Where Sonic will dash towards an enemy and combo them, Shadow works best from a distance.</p>
            <p>Shadow's skill floor is rather low, however so is his skill ceiling, and therefore his gameplay doesn't match the depth of Sonic's.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Shadow can jump while he's already mid-air, to extend his aerial movement and gain extra height and distance.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air, while next to a wall <br> 
                    Shadow can perform a wall jump, which causes him to push himself off of it, no matter what direction he's facing, even if he isn't facing the wall.<br>
                    This is primarily used for mobility, and some obstacles require its repeated use to scale opposing walls.<br>
                    Wall jumping also restores Shadow's double jump.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Shadow can thrust himself downward and slam into the ground. This technique damages and launches enemies in a low radius. Jump immediately after a Slam Attack to jump higher. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crouch Slide</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> while moving <br> 
                    Crouch sliding allows Shadow to glide across the ground, boosting his speed.<br>
                    Jumping during a Crouch Slide increases Shadow's jump distance based on his velocity.<br>
                    It's excellent for maintaining momentum and achieving high ground speeds.<br>
                    Crouch sliding is particularly useful when using it to cancel Shadow's other movement skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chaos Snap</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br>
                    A variant of Chaos Control that lets Shadow teleport a short distance away.<br>
                    Can only be used twice mid-air, unless Shadow's holding the Chaos Emerald or is Super Shadow.<br>
                    If Shadow is holding the Chaos Emerald, he'll be able to use it thrice mid-air.<br>
                    Shadow is invincible during this technique.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Punch</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when close to a target <br>
                    Shadow can destroy most enemies with a single punch.<br>
                    If he's in his Super Form, his punches will cause an explosion.<br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chaos Spear</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br>
                    Shadow can fire a Chaos Spear from his hand if he isn't close up to an enemy.<br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Homing Assault</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd>* when Homing Reticle appears <br>
                    Shadow's variation on the Homing Attack.<br>
                    The Homing Assault will have Shadow rapidly dash towards his target and unleash a surge
                    of Chaos Energy, dealing significant damage to the target and additional damage to any 
                    other enemies in range.<br>
                    Unlike Sonic's Homing Attack, Shadow has to be in the air before he can perform the
                    Homing Assault.
                </li>
                <p>* This input can be changed to <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> by enabling the alternative control under <code>Options > Abilities > Homing Assault Input (Shadow)</code>.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Shovel</strong> - A rather tall shovel that Shadow owns, given to him by Knuckles, who owns an identical one. Whenever Shadow heads out with Knuckles to deal with a problem involving an annoying adversary that deserves to be buried in the ground, he takes the shovel with him. Afterwards, the hedgehog and echidna typically perform a 'high shovel', in which they hit their shovels together in celebration. Yes, this is a reference to Tails Gets Trolled.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shovel Smash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing the High Shovel forward and destroy anything unlucky enough to be in your way. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Shadow zoom forward at high speed, similar to Sonic's version of the move. It starts up faster and can be held in mid-air, but Boost Jumping is less effective and Shadow descends quickly when using it in the air, kind of like in Sonic Forces.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Troll Slaiying Knife</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UzEHKyUZp4&t=354s">They cant troll you if there dead!</a> The ultimate troll slaiying weapon, which deals enough damage to one-shot basically every enemy in the game. They say a fricking demon with goat horns is the answer to finding this coveted weapon.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ultimate Stab</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Strike with the Troll Slaiying Knife, which kills ANYTHING it touches. Can activate attackable switches.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-Machine Gun</strong> - The standard-issue G.U.N. assault weapon, which Shadow carries to any and all missions, even if he doesn't need to use it. He even built a holster on his Dark Rider motorcycle for it. . .</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Rapidly fire the SMG.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Dark Assaulter</strong> - An assault shotgun, taken from G.U.N.'s armory. Shadow had convinced his superiors it would help him on his mission.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assault Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire shotgun blasts.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Quartenary Decimator</strong> - A rather terrifying-looking four-barreled weapon that Shadow had retrieved from a high-security enemy base. Technically speaking, it's the property of G.U.N., but Shadow's the only one who even has the courage to use the thing. Its pellet spread and high recoil is insane, and every other G.U.N. agent is afraid of <em>literally</em> shooting themselves in the foot.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Decimation Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire an ungodly amount of pellets.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Chaos Emerald</strong> - A Chaos Emerald replica Shadow had built using stolen Eggman tech, motivated by his determination to harness the Chaos Emeralds' power. It harnesses and rapidly supplies Chaos Energy, and Shadow can fire an incredibly powerful blast, which subtracts a lot of his Chaos Energy, but the weapon regenerates itself, so it's not so bad.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Blast</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a BFG blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Chaos Emerald <br> The Chaos Emerald replica can heal Shadow, and heals a lot faster than Sonic's Eclipse Blaster Mk. V does.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Dual Assimilator</strong> - Ripped right off of an enormous turret from an Eggman base, this weapon fires two homing rockets that deal so much devastation, it could kill its wielder in a single hit if they were anywhere close to the blast radius. Shadow has to constantly remind himself not to use it for propelling himself in the air.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire two auto-targeted missiles. DO NOT FIRE THIS AT A CLOSE RANGE. Actually, just don't use this fire mode if you're near any enemies you're not facing towards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Untargeted Launch</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Fire two non-targeted missiles that just go straight forward. Can still absolutely destroy you if you aren't careful.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
