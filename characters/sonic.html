            <h1>Sonic the Hedgehog</h1>
            <img src=sonic.png id=character />
            <p>VA: Jason Griffith</p>
            <p>Sonic is the face of Sonic: Lock & Load, reflected by his super high mobility and multitude of ways to get around the environment, both on the ground and in the air.</p>
            <p>Sonic focuses mostly on stylish and split-second action, similar to fast-paced games like DOOM Eternal or ULTRAKILL.</p>
            <p>Out of the entire cast of the game, Sonic is the character with the highest skill ceiling and highest combo potential. He's also just the character that's the most developed, since it's his name on the game's title.</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Double Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Sonic can jump while he's already mid-air, to extend his aerial movement and gain extra height and distance.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Wall Jump</strong> - <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air, while next to a wall <br> 
                    Sonic can perform a wall jump, which causes him to push himself off of it, no matter what direction he's facing, even if he isn't facing the wall.<br>
                    This is primarily used for mobility, and some obstacles require its repeated use to scale opposing walls.<br>
                    Wall jumping also restores Sonic's double jump.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Slam Attack</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> mid-air <br>
                    Sonic can thrust himself downward and slam into the ground. This technique damages and launches enemies in a low radius. Jump immediately after a Slam Attack to jump higher. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crouch Slide</strong> - <kbd>Crouch</kbd> while moving <br> 
                    Crouch sliding allows Sonic to glide across the ground, boosting his speed.<br>
                    Jumping during a Crouch Slide increases Sonic's jump distance based on his velocity.<br>
                    It's excellent for maintaining momentum and achieving high ground speeds.<br>
                    Crouch sliding is particularly useful when using it to cancel Sonic's other movement skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quick Step</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> <br> 
                    Sonic can quickly sidestep to avoid attacks or move fast quickly. A Quick Step will render Sonic invulnerable for 10 tics (just over a quarter of a second). Hold down any movement keys during a Quick Step to move in that direction.<br>
                    Can be cancelled into a jump or crouch slide, which prevents Sonic from coming to a halt after performing the move.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Quick Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd>, <kbd>Crouch</kbd> <br>
                    An advanced technique. Sonic can perform the Quick Dash by cancelling a Quick Step into a Crouch Slide, cancelling the Quick Step's momentum halt and allowing Sonic to use the full speed of Quick Step. <br>
                    If you chain multiple Quick Dashes together, it allows Sonic to move extremely fast in a short amount of time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Perfect Quick Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> then immediately <kbd>Crouch</kbd> <br>
                    If the Quick Dash is timed precisely, the Quick Step's dash will be combined with the Crouch Slide's speed boost, causing Sonic to zip in the Quick Step direction at a stupid fast speed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> 
                    Sonic's able to deliver a swift kick from his right foot at any time, dealing damage and knockback to any enemy he's
                    up close to, even if he's in the process of using a weapon.<br>
                    If Sonic's off the ground, his kick will deal double damage, and he'll swing from above rather than from the right.<br>
                    Can activate attackable switches. Becomes Homing Attack if the Homing Reticle is active.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Homing Attack</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> when Homing Reticle appears <br>
                    Sonic can perform a Homing Attack, launching himself towards a target and performing a lightning-fast kick, 
                    rebounding off of his target, which can be used for positioning himself for combos or mobility.<br>
                    If a Double Jump wasn't used, you can press <kbd>Jump</kbd> as soon as Sonic rebounds to rebound higher, 
                    which is extremely useful for mobility and positioning.<br>
                    For extra style, follow up a Homing Attack with a heavy-impact weapon attack while jumping away. <br>
                    Can activate attackable switches.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - The legendary sacred sword from a dimension of stories. Caliburn once assisted Sonic on his journey to stop King Arthur's reign of terror back when he was sent into the world of Arthurian legend.<br>Tails had managed to reverse-engineer the power of the book in order to bring Caliburn to Sonic's world, in the present timeline, and now he's along for the ride!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sword Slash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> on the ground <br>
                        Swing Caliburn from side to side. Rapidly press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to perform a combo. Attacks in a wide radius,
                        but is fairly weak. Probably not a good idea to use for a tough enemy if you just go in swinging.
                        Does not trigger enemies' pain state. Due to its rapid nature, Sword Slash doesn't grant as much Style Points
                        as it normally would.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Air Slash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> mid-air <br>
                        Perform a downward aerial slash with Caliburn. Much stronger than a standard Sword Swing, but it can't be used
                        for combos. It shares every other property with Sword Slash, including the ability to parry enemy attacks up close.
                        Unlike Sword Slash, Air Slash does not limit the amount of Style Points you get from an attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Boost Slash</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> during Boost <br>
                        If Sonic swings Caliburn in the middle of performing the Boost, the attack will be a <strong>lot</strong> more
                        powerful than a standard Sword Slash. Damage scales depending on Boost speed, so you can combo an Accel Boost
                        into Boost Slash for maximum damage. Shares every other property with Sword Slash, and lets Sonic parry just
                        the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Parry</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> when enemy attacks <br>
                        Up close to an enemy, attack with Caliburn within 0.2 seconds (6 <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/Definitions
                        #Units_of_time">tics</a>) of an enemy's attack to parry it, turning the enemy's attack against itself, removing
                        over a third of its health and flinging them far away! Parrying only works on the first swing, and won't be active
                        during a Sword Slash combo.<br>
                        And remember, you have to be close enough to an enemy to parry its attacks!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Sonic zoom forward at high speed. The longer you hold, the
                        faster it'll go. If Sonic's already moving faster than his minimum Boost speed, it'll be inherited from his current
                        speed. Press <kbd>Jump</kbd> to perform a Boost Jump, which preserves the Boost's momentum and gives Sonic a height
                        boost. Cannot be held mid-air, unless you're Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accel Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> right after <kbd>Forward</kbd> <br> Accel Boost will make Sonic
                        blast off at his maximum Boost speed. This can be used to quickly zip to a far-away point, in case the regular initial
                        Boost speed isn't enough for you. Functionally identical to the Boost. The input leniency for Accel Boost requires pressing
                        <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> within around 3/35ths of a second (0.08 seconds) after pressing <kbd>Forward</kbd>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Pistol</strong> - A modified G.U.N. sidearm, retrieved by Sonic during a mission, and fixed up by Tails.<br>The weapon can be shifted to take advantage of the railgun module Tails had installed, allowing Sonic to charge up a shot that sends him flying back.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burst Fire</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire three bullets in quick succession. If Sonic is in the air, each bullet will do double damage. Can be spammed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recoil Burst</strong> - Charge with <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd>, press <kbd>Fire</kbd> to use* <br> Charge a railgun blast, and then fire. The longer you charge, the more powerful the attack will be, and the more energy it'll consume. Recoil Burst will also send Sonic flying in the opposite direction he's facing, making it an excellent mobility tool. If followed up immediately with <kbd>Fire</kbd>, the cooldown will be skipped, allowing you to quickly combo into Burst Fire.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>* This input can be changed to simply releasing <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> by enabling the alternative control under <code>Options > Abilities > Recoil Burst Input (Sonic)</code> to <code>Release Alt-Fire</code>.</p>
                <li><strong>Kinetic Shotty</strong> - Built from parts from a destroyed Eggman robot, the Kinetic Shotty uses static electricity to fire a wide spread of Chaos Energy pellets, with the number of pellets increasing with the amount of power supplied, which is seemingly limitless. Tails had a grenade launcher addon installed, which taps into the same power source. Somehow, he managed to make the projectile look like a rocket. . .</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shotty Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a wide spread of pellets. The faster Sonic's going, the more pellets will be fired, and the higher the damage output. If Sonic's in the air, the spread will be tighter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kinetic Grenade</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Launch a grenade that inherits Sonic's current momentum. <strong>Autoaim really messes with this fire mode, you should probably turn it off.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Shuriken Crossbow</strong> - A crossbow given to Sonic by Espio.<br>It uses the power of magnetism to temporarily fuse the shuriken to the weapon's base, and the projectile is flung forward at high speed when the magnetic field is released.<br>The shuriken, made with Chaos Energy, is quite durable, and will tear tbrough as many targets as are in its way.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shuriken Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a shuriken that tears through multiple enemies. Has a bit of a long cooldown.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V</strong> - A prototype energy weapon retrieved from G.U.N. which seems to have originated from the Space Colony ARK. The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V fires a stream of energy at its targets, but, being a prototype, it's susceptible to overheating. The Eclipse Blaster can resonate with the Chaos Energy present within Sonic and allow him to restore his Rings, but it uses quite a lot of his Energy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>Fire a stream of plasma that deals continuous damage to enemies. The stream can be held down for up to three seconds before overheating, but it can cool down even if Sonic isn't holding it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Eclipse Blaster Mk. V <br> The Eclipse Blaster Mk. V can heal Sonic. It drains a <em>lot</em> of Chaos Energy, so use with care.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Rioter</strong> - A rocket launcher ripped from an Eggman robot, with a quick loading mechanic that lets it fire rockets faster than a regular rocket launcher. It has a second trigger on it which allows any rockets in flight to be remotely detonated.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rocket Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rocket. Deals more damage if fired while Sonic is in the air. Can be launched as fast as you can click the button. The rocket will inherit Sonic's momentum, but not as much as the Kinetic Grenade. Sonic can Homing Attack the rocket to make it home in on enemies, which will also launch himself forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote Detonation</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> with Rocket Rioter <br> Sonic will remotely make any rockets he fired explode, even if the rocket was just fired. Meaning you can do mid-air rocket jumps.</li>
                </ul>
