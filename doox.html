            <h1>This is Doox</h1>
            <img src="doox.png" />
            <p>Small, cute and a god?!</p>
            <p>This funky guy is only here to cheer you on, and <em>maybe</em> convince you to buy Doox Cola.</p>
            <blockquote>"It tastes good, trust me!" - Doox</blockquote>
            <h2>Where to find him</h2>
            <img src="doox-screenshot.png" class="framed" />
            <p>You can find Doox chilling on the bench in Station Square, as he takes in the scenery. He likes looking at the bricks.</p>
            <p>Attack him, and you'll find that he'll go sliding around on the floors. Don't worry, <strong>he physically cannot die.</strong></p>
            <p>Press the <kbd>Interact</kbd> key on him for him to make a funny noise. This has no effect on gameplay, but it does have an effect on your mental state, providing you (the player) with Doox Energy.</p>
            <p>If he manages to touch an enemy while he's sliding around, the enemy will just immediately die.</p>
            <h2>Where he comes from</h2>
            <p>Doox came from The Hole.</p>
            <p>Just kidding. He's the rather glorious child of both <a href="https://twitter.com/DextremeArrow">Dex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BaconBSide">Mariya</a>.</p>
            <p>I asked Dex if I could put him in Sonic: Lock & Load when v1.0 rolled around and he basically immediately said yes, which was very nice of him.</p>
