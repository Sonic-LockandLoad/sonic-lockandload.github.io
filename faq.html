            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</em></h1>
            <p><em>Disclaimer:</em> These questions were not actually frequently asked. Except the Big the Cat one.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Is Sonic: Lock &amp; Load related at all to Sonic Robo Blast 2?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>No - Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a completely different project from Sonic: Lock &amp; Load.</li>
                        <li>SRB2 is a 3D platformer, not a first-person shooter. The only thing it remotely shares in common with S:L&L is that it's Doom-based.</li>
                       <li>S:L&L <em>does</em> take inspiration from SRB2, though.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Who even wanted a Sonic first-person shooter?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>Me. I wanted it.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>How do I play this thing?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>You need <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a> and a copy of DOOM. If you don't want to buy DOOM, <a href="https://freedoom.github.io">Freedoom</a> will work just as well.</li>
                        <li>You should use either DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2 if you want to play any Lock &amp; Load specific content.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why is Classic Sonic in the game?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>I wanted to bring back the original style from Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's predecessor. He's not just a Sonic clone -- he's his own character.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Where can I ask about or complain about the mod?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>You can leave an <a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/issues/new/choose">issue</a> on the GitHub repo.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why aren't Tails or Knuckles playable??</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>The former because I can't draw sprites for Tails that look good, and the latter because I don't know what gameplay style Knuckles would have.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why do big rings only give you up to 300 rings?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>Balancing reasons. Prior to S:L&amp;L v1.0, they used to give you up to 999, which basically gave you enough health to practically just walk through every level nonchalantly.</li>
                        <li>In addition, the player character will take extra damage if their ring count exceeds 300. Again, for balancing.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Can you add Big the Cat?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>No.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why don't you make your own assets?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>I'm not a talented artist. If I were able to, I would, but art, especially sprite art, is hard.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why is Amy's in-game sprite based on her Classic design, but the art used is her Modern design?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>Read the above.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Can I play Sonic: Lock &amp; Load with a controller?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>You can, but you probably shouldn't. S:L&amp;L is really fast-paced and requires precision at high levels of play, not to mention additional inputs beyond just <kbd>Fire</kbd> and <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> which is better with keyboard and mouse. Of course, if you want to, you can play S:L&amp;L with a controller on the highest difficulty, I won't stop you.</li>
                    </ul>
