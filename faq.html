            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</em></h1>
            <h3>Q: Is Sonic: Lock & Load related to Sonic Robo Blast 2?</h3>
            <p>A: No, Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a completely different project from Sonic: Lock & Load.</p>
            <p>SRB2 is a 3D platformer, not a first-person shooter. The only thing it remotely shares in common with S:L&L is that it's DOOM-based. S:L&L does, however, take inspiration from SRB2.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why didn't you just base this off SRB2?</h3>
            <p>SRB2 would have been a nice platform to build off of, sure, but do you think people would have shown as much interest if it were just another SRB2 mod?</p>
            <p>Plus, SRB2 is fundamentally a different game, with a different engine. Just because it's DOOM-based doesn't mean it is DOOM.</p>
            <p>Not even to mention I didn't know SRB2 existed back when I started Sonic: Lock & Load.</p>

            <h3>Q: Who wanted a Sonic first-person shooter?</h3>
            <p>A: Me, the creator of Sonic: Lock & Load, wanted it.</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I play Sonic: Lock & Load?</h3>
            <p>A: You need GZDoom and a copy of DOOM. If you don't want to buy DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2. DOOM 1 isn't supported anymore, maybe Legacy Edition would be better for you?</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Classic Sonic in the game?</h3>
            <p>A: I wanted to bring back the original style from Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, Sonic: Lock & Load's predecessor. Classic Sonic is not just a clone of Sonic -- he's his own character.</p>

            <h3>Q: Where can I ask about or complain about the mod?</h3>
            <p>A: You can leave an issue on the GitHub repo.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why aren't Tails or Knuckles playable?</h3>
            <p>A: Tails isn't playable because I can't draw for Tails that look good. Knuckles isn't playable because I don't know what gameplay style Knuckles would have.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why do big rings only give you up to 300 rings?</h3>
            <p>A: For balancing reasons. Prior to S:L&L v1.0, they used to give you up to 999 rings, which gave you enough health to practically walk through every level nonchalantly. In addition, the player character will take extra damage if their ring count exceeds 300.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can you add Big the Cat?</h3>
            <p>A: No.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why don't you make your own assets?</h3>
            <p>A: I'm not a talented artist and I find art, especially sprite art, hard.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Amy's in-game sprite based on her Classic design, but the art used is her Modern design?</h3>
            <p>A: Again, I'm not a talented artist and art is hard.</p>

            <h3>Q: Then can't you just change her in-game sprite to resemble Modern Amy?</h3>
            <p>A: I could do that, yeah, but it's not on my list of priorities right now. Maybe in v1.4.1.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I play Sonic: Lock & Load with a controller?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes, of course you can! GZDoom includes support for controllers by default.</p>
            <p>You may have trouble adjusting to S:L&L's fast-paced twitchy action on a controller, but it's certainly doable.</p>
            <p>A controller with gyro (DualShock 4, DualSense, Switch Pro) helps.</p>
            <p>It's still recommended you play with a keyboard and mouse if you reasonably can, though.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I play Sonic: Lock & Load with a touchscreen?</h3>
            <p>A: Pfft. Good luck. Not only does S:L&L have additional keybindings (<kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> and <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd>), but it's designed to take advantage of loads of inputs at once or in quick succession.</p>
            <p>It'd be like trying to play DOOM 2016 or ULTRAKILL on a touchscreen - it's not going to turn out well.</p>
            <p>Is it technically possible? Yes, technically, it is. Is it advised? No, absolutely not.<br>Get a controller for your device, or hook up a keyboard and mouse. </p>
