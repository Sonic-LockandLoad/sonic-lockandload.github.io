            <h1>Frequently Anticipated Questions</em></h1>
            <h3>Q: Is Sonic: Lock & Load related to Sonic Robo Blast 2?</h3>
            <p>A: No, Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a completely different project from Sonic: Lock & Load.</p>
            <p>SRB2 is a 3D platformer, not a first-person shooter. The only thing it remotely shares in common with S:L&L is that it's DOOM-based.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why didn't you just base this off Sonic Robo Blast 2?</h3>
            <p>A: SRB2 would have been a nice platform to build off of, sure, but there's one problem with that - SRB2 sucks as an FPS game engine. If you don't believe me, play SRB2 in first person.</p>
            <p>SRB2 is fundamentally a different game, with a different engine. Just because it's DOOM-based doesn't mean it is DOOM. GZDoom is overall a better FPS engine.</p>

            <h3>Q: Who wanted a Sonic first-person shooter?</h3>
            <p>A: Me. I wanted it. Next question?</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I play Sonic: Lock & Load?</h3>
            <p>A: You need GZDoom and a copy of DOOM II: Hell on Earth. GZDoom can be obtained from <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">the ZDoom website</a>, and DOOM II can be bought from either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/doom_ii">GOG</a>.</p>
            <p>If you don't want to or can't buy DOOM II, you can use the free and open-source <a href="https://freedoom.github.io/download.html">Freedoom: Phase 2</a>. Since DOOM II is copyrighted, I can't tell you where to get the IWAD for free. Sorry, that's how law works.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Classic Sonic in the game?</h3>
            <p>A: I wanted to bring back the original style from Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, Sonic: Lock & Load's predecessor. Classic Sonic is not just a clone of Sonic -- he's his own character.</p>

            <h3>Q: Where can I ask about or complain about the mod?</h3>
            <p>A: You can leave an issue on the GitHub repo.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why aren't Tails or Knuckles playable?</h3>
            <p>A: Tails isn't playable because I can't draw for Tails that look good. Knuckles isn't playable because I don't know what gameplay style Knuckles would have.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can you add Big the Cat?</h3>
            <p>A: No.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why don't you make your own assets?</h3>
            <p>A: I'm not a talented artist and I find art, especially sprite art, hard.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Amy's in-game sprite based on her Classic design, but the art used is her Modern design?</h3>
            <p>A: Again, I'm not a talented artist and art is hard.</p>

            <h3>Q: Then can't you just change her in-game sprite to resemble Modern Amy?</h3>
            <p>A: I could do that, yeah, but it's not on my list of priorities right now. Maybe in v1.4.1.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I play Sonic: Lock & Load with a controller?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes, of course you can! GZDoom includes support for controllers by default.</p>
            <p>You may have trouble adjusting to S:L&L's fast-paced twitchy action on a controller, but it's certainly doable.</p>
            <p>A controller with gyro (DualShock 4, DualSense, Switch Pro) helps, you can configure those through Steam Input I think.</p>
            <p>It's still recommended you play with a keyboard and mouse if you reasonably can, though.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I play Sonic: Lock & Load with a touchscreen?</h3>
            <p>A: Yes? Good luck trying, though. Not only does S:L&L have additional keybindings (<kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> and <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd>), but it's designed to take advantage of loads of inputs at once or in quick succession.</p>
            <p>It'd be like trying to play DOOM 2016 or ULTRAKILL on a touchscreen - it's not going to turn out well.</p>
            <p>Is it technically possible? Yes, technically, it is. Is it advised? No, absolutely not. Get a controller for your device, or hook up a keyboard and mouse.</p>
