            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</em></h1>
            <h3>Q: Is Sonic: Lock & Load related to Sonic Robo Blast 2?</h3>
            <p>A: No, Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a completely different project from Sonic: Lock & Load. SRB2 is a 3D platformer, not a first-person shooter. The only thing it remotely shares in common with S:L&L is that it's Doom-based. S:L&L does, however, take inspiration from SRB2.</p>

            <h3>Q: Who wanted a Sonic first-person shooter?</h3>
            <p>A: Me, the creator of Sonic: Lock & Load, wanted it.</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I play Sonic: Lock & Load?</h3>
            <p>A: You need GZDoom and a copy of DOOM. If you don't want to buy DOOM, Freedoom will work just as well. You should use either DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2 if you want to play any Sonic: Lock & Load specific content.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Classic Sonic in the game?</h3>
            <p>A: I wanted to bring back the original style from Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, Sonic: Lock & Load's predecessor. Classic Sonic is not just a clone of Sonic -- he's his own character.</p>

            <h3>Q: Where can I ask about or complain about the mod?</h3>
            <p>A: You can leave an issue on the GitHub repo.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why aren't Tails or Knuckles playable?</h3>
            <p>A: Tails isn't playable because I can't draw for Tails that look good. Knuckles isn't playable because I don't know what gameplay style Knuckles would have.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why do big rings only give you up to 300 rings?</h3>
            <p>A: For balancing reasons. Prior to S:L&L v1.0, they used to give you up to 999 rings, which gave you enough health to practically walk through every level nonchalantly. In addition, the player character will take extra damage if their ring count exceeds 300.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can you add Big the Cat?</h3>
            <p>A: No.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why don't you make your own assets?</h3>
            <p>A: I'm not a talented artist and I find art, especially sprite art, hard.</p>

            <h3>Q: Why is Amy's in-game sprite based on her Classic design, but the art used is her Modern design?</h3>
            <p>A: Again, I'm not a talented artist and art is hard.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I play Sonic: Lock & Load with a controller?</h3>
            <p>A: You can, but it's not recommended. S:L&L is fast-paced and requires precision at high levels of play. It also requires additional inputs beyond just <kbd>Fire</kbd> and <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> which are better with keyboard and mouse. Of course, if you want to play S:L&L with a controller on the highest difficulty, no one will stop you.</p>
