            <img src="TITLEPIC.png" />
            <p>
                Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is a Sonic the Hedgehog-based first-person shooter on the
                <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a> source port, currently a mod that requires DOOM 2's IWAD.
            </p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is free software under the 3-clause BSD license.</p>
            <p>It's not really based on any kind of Sonic game in particular, instead taking inspiration from the entire franchise.</p>
            <p>It's also currently very unfinished, and development is kind of slow.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is a project by <a href="https://that1m8head.github.io/">Arsalan Kazmi</a>.</p>

                <p>This is normally the part where the changelog would go, but it's <em>massive</em>, and I'm lazy, so... just go to the GitHub release page.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.0-chaos">Version 1.0</a></h3>
                <p>
                    It's been a long, rough road, but we're finally here.<br>
                    The long-awaited first release for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, the Chaos Update, is finally out!<br>
                    So without further ado... <strong>Welcome to the next level.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chaos Update is a turning point for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, becoming more than a simple DOOM mod some bored guy threw together after watching Peter Knetter videos.</p>

                <h2>Pre-releases</h2>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/dark">Dark (0.9)</a></h3>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's Dark Update adds Shadow the Hedgehog! It's time to go and find that damn FOURTH Chaos Emerald!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Shadow the Hedgehog.</li>
                    <li>Added a taunt command which can be bound in the GZDoom settings.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn now has a rotating attack outside of Super Sonic.</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Amy.</li>
                    <li>Hammer Jump is now triggered by crouching and pressing primary fire.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/rose">Rose (0.8)</a></h3>
                <p>Oh boy! The Rose Update! This is probably the greatest addition to the mod in ages.</p>
                <p>This update marks the project's name change from 'Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM' to 'Sonic: Lock &amp; Load'.</p>
                <p>This was done:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>as both a reference to His World from Sonic '06</li>
                    <li>because I didn't want Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM (or Sonic DOOM) to be confused with Sonic Robo Blast 2, which is what most people think of when they hear "Sonic DOOM" (which didn't work at all, even YouTube thinks S:L&amp;L is SRB2)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's the changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Amy Rose.</li>
                    <li>Renamed Sonic's Eclipse Blaster to the "Eclipse Blaster Mk. V"</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed the Speedy Shotgun. </li>
                    <li>Removed the tutorial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v5-release">Ascension (0.7)</a></h3>
                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM's Ascension Update grants Sonic a revamped Boost that lets him ascend! (hence the title)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed how the Boost works.</li>
                    <li>Removed the Drift.</li>
                    <li>Added an unarmed kick.</li>
                    <li>DOOM II text screens reflect Sonic's dialogue and mimic Sonic Adventure 2's recap screens.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v4b-release">Eclipse (0.6)</a></h3>

                    <li>Changed how the Speedy Shotgun works.</li>

                    <li>Weapon pickup messages now reflect Sonic's reactions.</li>
                </ul>
