            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is a hyper-fast character-action first-person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games and built on <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a>.</p>
            <p>It draws inspiration from Sonic games, as well as titles like Sonic Robo Blast 2, ULTRAKILL and DOOM Eternal. It also features elements from other GZDoom mods, retro FPS games and other character-action games.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load is not fully completed yet, and development is progressing slowly. However, it aims to provide an extremely fun and thrilling experience reminiscent of old-school shooters, as well as their modern-day revivals.</p>
            <p>The latest stable version is the currently outdated <strong>v1.3.3</strong>, and the latest demo is the <strong>v1.4 Final Final Demo</strong>.</p>
            <p>There's also a side project available, <a href="legacy.html">Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM: Legacy Edition</a>.</p>

            <div class="releases">
                <h2>Version v1.4 “Horizons”</h2>
                <p style="color:#a115f1;text-align:center;">Releasing in December 2023</p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4 “Horizons” is a major update, bringing
                    new levels, new techniques, refinements to the changes made in v1.3.3 and
                    major changes to the gameplay and Sonic: Lock &amp; Load’s fundamentals.</p>
                <p>How many times have I said “welcome to the next level” anyway?</p>
                <p>Really? Only three? Funny, seemed like more.</p>
                <p><strong>This probably isn’t an extensive list,</strong> since
                    Horizons has been through so many changes that I’ve lost track of it
                    all. Makes the jump from Dark (v0.9) to Chaos (v1.0) look like a joke
                    and a half.</p>

                <h3 id="levels">Levels</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sunset Gardens, replacing v1.3’s Green Hill</li>
                    <li>Marble Madness</li>
                    <li>Oceanic Fortress</li>
                    <li>Hire This Zone, a massive level inspired by Sonic Frontiers, featuring a
                        Super Sonic boss fight. Only accessible by Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Cyber Space Arena, an endless survival mode that is <em>not</em>
                        wave based, not even slightly. It’s more “see how long you can last” and
                        not “see how far you can get”.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <kbd>Offhand</kbd> command has been split into <kbd>Offhand
                        Attack</kbd> and <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd>. Offhand Attacks
                        are. . .well, offhand attacks, and Offhand Abilities are
                        usually movement options that don’t deal damage.</li>
                    <li>Movement changes; pressing no movement keys mid-air will preserve
                        your horizontal momentum, but pressing movement keys will still have an
                        effect on mid-air movement.</li>
                    <li>When low on Rings (below 10) you’ll start to hear a low health
                        sound.</li>
                    <li>You’ll also start hearing a low energy sound if you’re about to lose
                        your Super, Dark or Hyper Form due to having a low amount of Chaos
                        Energy.</li>
                    <li>You’ll now always run at a high speed, irregardless of the
                        <code>cl_run</code> CVAR.
                    </li>
                    <li>When double jumping, the second jump will now have less height.</li>
                    <li>Upon taking damage, your character will drop rings that can be
                        picked back up, and will disappear after a short while.</li>
                    <li>Every character can now perform the Slam Attack by simply 
                        pressing <kbd>Crouch</kbd>, not just Sonic. You can also use it
                        at any time, independent of your weapon.</li>
                    <li>When on the ground and moving, you’re able to crouch slide by
                        holding down <kbd>Crouch</kbd>. Crouch sliding will preserve more of your
                        momentum than just moving, and can be used to gain and maintain high
                        ground speeds.</li>
                    <li>Super and Dark forms have been slowed down, and Hyper forms have been
                        made as fast as Super forms used to be.</li>
                    <li>New optional toggleable gameplay modifiers, that can add or change around
                        game mechanics.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Give Energy on damage</strong> &ndash; Dealing damage to or killing monsters will net you some Chaos Energy, which is capped at either 300 or 500 Energy depending on if the monster was only damaged or was killed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enemies bleed rings</strong> &ndash; Upon taking damage, enemies will drop Rings that don't last very long, similar to the blood mechanic in ULTRAKILL.</li>
                            <li><strong>Style System</strong> &ndash; Continuously attack enemies to rack up Style Points and get a high Style Rank! Taking damage or even just waiting around will make your Style Points decrease. Maintaining a Style Rank of at least B will generate Chaos Energy, so playing stylishly will ensure you'll basically never run out of ammo!</li>
                            <li><strong>Spongy Enemies</strong> &ndash; Are you sick and tired of enemies dying too quickly? Enable this gameplay modifier, and all enemies will have their health multiplied, so you can style on them all you like!</li>
                            <li><strong>One-Hit Mode</strong> &ndash; Think you're good at the game? Good enough to rush past everything in your way? Enable this gameplay modifier to have any damage dealt to you instantly kill you!</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Difficulty levels have been overhauled completely.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Effortless</strong> (Skill 1) - Enemies move slowly and the spawn level is Normal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplified</strong> (Skill 2) - Enemies move slowly and the spawn level is Hard, meaning there are more enemies around.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard</strong> (Skill 3, Default) - Enemies move faster than Skill 1/2 and the spawn level is Hard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Insane</strong> (Skill 4) - Enemies move faster than Skill 1/2, spawn level is Hard and the player takes twice the usual damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oh No</strong> (Skill 5) - Enemies move faster than Skill 1/2, spawn level is Nightmare and the player and enemies all die in one hit. Same as ever.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="characters">Characters</h3>
                <h4 id="sonic">Sonic the Hedgehog</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sonic’s Offhand Attack is now Homing Attack. The Homing Attack
                        can be performed whenever Sonic’s looking at an enemy and the Homing
                        Reticle is displayed in the middle of the screen and will cause Sonic to
                        teleport to the enemy and deliver a swift kick. If Sonic’s too close to or
                        too far from an enemy (the Homing Reticle doesn’t appear) Sonic will just
                        kick normally instead.</li>
                    <li>Sonic’s Offhand Ability is the Quick Step, which is an unlimited
                        dash ability that can be used to evade enemy attacks or get closer to an
                        enemy. It can be cancelled into a jump or crouch slide for extra
                        mobility.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn has been massively tweaked, and Sonic can now perform sword
                        combos by repeatedly pressing<kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn can now also parry close-up attacks if Sonic swings it
                        right before he gets attacked.</li>
                    <li>Boost can no longer be held down if Sonic’s using it mid-air, unless
                        he’s in his Super or Hyper Form.</li>
                    <li>Accelerated Pistol now uses a single-shot spammable burst fire.</li>
                    <li>Recoil Burst must now be charged for at least a little bit.</li>
                    <li>Wall Jump now works a lot more like ULTRAKILL’s, where it’s not
                        nearly as overpowered and Sonic will no longer look behind him after
                        performing the move.</li>
                    <li>Rapid Shotty has been replaced by the Kinetic Shotty, which has a
                        primary fire that scales its amount of pellets with Sonic’s velocity,
                        and a secondary fire that’s a momentum-inheriting grenade.</li>
                    <li>Shuriken Crossbow now has a better sound when the shuriken hits its
                        target.</li>
                    <li>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V now has a cooldown period after firing for around
                        three seconds - and Chaos Restoration will consume a lot more Chaos Energy.</li>
                    <li>Rocket Rioter’s rockets can now be Homing Attacked to turn them into
                        homing rockets with more damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="amy">Amy Rose</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amy’s movement speed and jump height are now the same as everyone
                        else’s.</li>
                    <li>She also no longer takes increased damage from attacks.</li>
                    <li>Amy’s Offhand Ability is the Slide Dash, which can slide over gaps
                        and can be jumped out of, which grants Amy quite a lot of mobility.</li>
                    <li>Piko Piko Hammer now requires a bit of timing for the attack or
                        Hammer Jump to connect, and Amy can now use the hammer to parry incoming
                        attacks in exchange for Chaos Energy.</li>
                    <li>Piko Piko Hammer can no longer be used for gliding.</li>
                    <li>Added the Railshot Cannon, a railgun with some knockback, like
                        Sonic’s Recoil Burst.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="classic-sonic">Classic Sonic</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classic Sonic now has access to the Spin Attack, Double Spin Attack
                        (Insta-Shield), and Drop Dash.</li>
                    <li>Spin Dash is now just<kbd>Fire</kbd> – you don’t need to crouch
                        anymore.</li>
                    <li>Sonic Thok has been moved to Offhand Ability, and can now be
                        activated with a double jump input, and Sonic can no longer aim it left,
                        right or backwards.</li>
                    <li>Drift has been heavily nerfed, and is nowhere near as effective
                        mid-air.</li>
                    <li>Classic Sonic can now regenerate up to 150 Rings on the spot, by
                        crouching and holding<kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd>. He takes extra damage while
                        doing so, though.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="shadow">Shadow the Hedgehog</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shadow has been made a lot more like Sonic – he can perform a lot of
                        the moves that Sonic can now.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Spear can now be used at any time, as Shadow’s Offhand
                        Attack.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Snap has been moved to Offhand Ability.</li>
                    <li>Holding the Chaos Emerald will give Shadow a third Chaos Snap.</li>
                    <li>Shadow can now perform the Boost with the High Shovel, the same way
                        Sonic can with Caliburn. It has a faster startup, uses less Chaos
                        Energy, can be held in mid-air and will be affected by gravity.</li>
                    <li>Added the Sub-Machine Gun, an automatic pistol that serves as
                        Shadow’s starting weapon.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The title screen theme is now Un-Gravitify from Sonic Riders: Zero
                        Gravity.</li>
                    <li>Secret bosses have been made much tougher, especially the Fricking
                        Cyberdemon, which is a lot more aggressive, and is now fought across all
                        of Station Square instead of a small enclosed arena.</li>
                    <li>Upon completing a level, your time and score are calculated, and
                        you’re given a rank based on how well you met the target time and
                        score.</li>
                    <li>Title screen graphics now have a small delay before appearing, to
                        fix problems with it on Linux.</li>
                    <li>Added Reserved Mode, which brings player movements speed down to a
                        more reasonable level. Intended for use with usual DOOM levels, and map
                        packs that weren’t designed for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load.</li>
                    <li>A Discord App ID has been added for Rich Presence, and can be used
                        by setting the <code>i_discordrpc</code> CVAR to <code>true</code>.</li>
                    <li>DOOM 2’s IWAD will now automatically be loaded if it’s detected by
                        GZDoom.</li>
                    <li>The “Hell on Earth” chapter (standard DOOM 2 levels) have been
                        hidden from the episode selection menu. Which kind of defeats the
                        purpose of Reserved Mode, but whatever. You can still access DOOM 2 maps
                        with <code>idclev</code> or <code>map</code>.</li>
                </ul>

                    Following is a list of things I considered adding into Horizons but didn't because
                    I either thought it was too soon and it would be too drastic of a change right now,
                    or because I'm lazy and didn't want to yet.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Soul Gauge, which would fill up upon dealing damage and empty over time or
                        when taking damage. This only exists in Horizons as the optional Style System
                        gameplay modifier. The Soul Gauge would have allowed your character to activate
                        their Super, Dark or Hyper form once full.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A fourth level, which would have included much, MUCH more crazy things in it, 
                        like a time-limited escape sequence. This was held back because Horizons was 
                        taking too long already and I just wanted to get this damn update out.
                        Plus, I have better ideas for a fourth level now . . .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Style switching, like in Devil May Cry. The idea being there would be a specialised
                        <kbd>Style Switch</kbd> key, and pressing that would have your character switch their
                        combat style. For example, Sonic would have had the evasion-oriented Speedster Style 
                        and the offence-oriented Black Knight Style. I would have loved to incorporate this
                        addition in particular, but I didn't simply because, again, I just wanted to get 
                        Horizons out already.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These ideas will probably either be implemented in v1.4.1 or v1.5.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.3">Version v1.3.3</a></h2>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.3 is a minor update, containing some changes to the game&#39;s fundamentals and balancing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Shuriken Crossbow damage output and end frames.</li>
                    <li>Both Eclipse Blasters&#39; knockback has been significantly reduced.</li>
                    <li>Increased Piko Piko Hammer damage output.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Emeralds won&#39;t replace soulspheres or megaspheres, instead only replacing the BFG9000.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Energy will now rapidly decrease in Dark or Hyper form instead of deducting 2 at once. This is more of a visual change.</li>
                    <li>The amount of energy you get from capsules is now reduced if you&#39;re in Super, Dark or Hyper form.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Rings will now give you extra Chaos Energy if transformed (2 for Super, 4 for Hyper and Dark).</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the Recoil Burst would still cost Chaos Energy when transformed.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.2">Version v1.3.2</a></h2>

					<li>Fixed an issue where completing Green Hill's boss was impossible.</li>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.1">Version v1.3.1</a></h2>
				<p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.1 is a minor update involving mostly bug fixes.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Skill 5 (Blue Streak/Thorned Rose/Fun is infinite/All Fail Shadow) no longer gives enemies double health.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue where finishing a level as Shadow would end before the victory jingle played.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue where Classic Sonic's mugshot wouldn't change when finishing a level.</li>
				</ul>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3">Version v1.3</a></h2>
				<p>Finally, a <strong>REAL</strong> update!</p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3 (which can be considered the real v1.1 but we won't get into that) adds an all-new Green Hill, a redesigned Station Square, new abilities and way more.</p>
				<p>We're getting closer and closer to SRB3...</p>
				<p>Well, what are you waiting for? Download it now and experience the next level! ... Whatever that means.</p>
                <p>This is normally the part where the changelog would go, but it's <em>massive</em>, and I'm lazy, so... just go to the GitHub release page.</p>

                    It's been a long, rough road, but we're finally here.<br>

                </p>
                <p>The Chaos Update is a turning point for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, becoming more than a simple DOOM mod some bored guy threw together after watching Peter Knetter videos.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/dark">Dark Update (v0.9)</a></h2>

                    <li>as both a reference to His World from Sonic '06</li>
                    <li>because I didn't want Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM (or Sonic DOOM) to be confused with Sonic Robo Blast 2, which is what most people think of when they hear "Sonic DOOM" (which didn't work at all, even YouTube thinks S:L&amp;L is SRB2)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's the changes:</p>
