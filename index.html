                <em>Sonic: Lock & Load</em> is a FLOSS (free/libre and open source software) first-person shooter on the GZDoom engine based on Sonic the Hedgehog, using DOOM as a base.<br>
                <em>(In other words, it's a DOOM mod.)</em><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Sonic: Lock & Load</em> aims to provide a fun fast-action FPS experience with a sense of overwhelming power.<br>
                It's not really based on any Sonic game in particular, and rather seeks to incorporate elements from the series as a whole.
