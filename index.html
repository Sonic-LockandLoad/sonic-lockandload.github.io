            <h2>Author & Support</h2>
            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is a solo project by <a href="https://that1m8head.github.io/">Arsalan "Aeria" Kazmi</a>, released as free software under the <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License v3</a>, and you can view the source code at <a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>If you thought there was a team behind this or something, then, uh... no. Just me.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load is very much still in its early development stages, despite having come so far. I'm just one guy, and I'm not a miracle worker.</p>
            <p>If you want to help with Sonic: Lock & Load, send me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/that1m8head">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/members/velocity.23429/">Sonic Fan Games HQ</a>, and we can work something out. Probably don't reach out on itch.io or Doomworld because I'm never on them nowadays.</p>
            <p>I'm currently looking for sprite artists (HUD sprites, weapon sprites, enemy sprites) and level designers, so if you think you can help, feel free to give me a shout.</p>
