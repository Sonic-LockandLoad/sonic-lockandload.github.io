            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is a Sonic the Hedgehog-based platforming-focused first-person shooter on the <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a> source port, i.e. a DOOM semi-total conversion that requires DOOM 2's IWAD.</p>
            <p>It's not really based on any kind of Sonic game in particular, instead taking inspiration from the entire franchise.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load is inspired by the entire Sonic the Hedgehog series of games, Sonic Robo Blast 2, DOOM Eternal, various GZDoom mods and various classic FPS games.</p>

            <h1>Releases</h1>
            <div class="releases">
                <h2>Chaos (1.x)</h2>

                <h3>Version 1.4</h3>
                <p style="color:red;text-align:center;">Future release</h3>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4 is a major update, bringing new levels, new techniques, refinements to the changes made in 1.3.x and major changes to the gameplay and Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's fundamentals.</p>
                <p>How many times have I said "welcome to the next level" anyway?</p>
                <p>Really? Only three? Funny, seemed like more.</p>
                <h4>Levels</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Green Hill is now Sunset Gardens, and has been made easier in order to ease players into Sonic: Lock &amp; Load.</li>
                    <li>Three more levels are planned.</li>
                    <li>All maps loaded before Sonic: Lock & Load will be inaccessible from the menu. You'll still be able to access them with <kbd>idclev</kbd> or the <code>map</code> console command.</li>
                    <li>You can now return to Station Square from Green Hill.</li>
                    <li>Added a new bonus level, "Hire This Level", a level that is just 49152 square map units of absolutely nothing.</li>
                    <li>Score is now counted at the end of a level.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <kbd>Offhand</kbd> command has been split into <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> and <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd>. Offhand Attacks are used for attacks (obviously) and Offhand Abilities are used for movement abilities.</li>
                    <li>Movement has been edited - if you're not pressing any movement keys, then you come to a stop faster than usual, and you preserve more aerial momentum. You can now jump as soon as you touch the ground.</li>
                    <li>Campaign bosses have been removed entirely, though the secret bosses in Station Square are still there.</li>
                    <li>Added a low health warning sound.</li>
                    <li>You now always move at the recommended speed, disregarding the <code>cl_run</code> console variable.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed double jump power.</li>
                    <li>The player will now actually drop rings upon taking damage. These rings will disappear after a while.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Character-specific</h4>
                <h5>Sonic</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added the Homing Snap, a technique that allows Sonic to dash towards a target at rapid speed, and be suspended mid-air for a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Added the Quick Step, which allows Sonic to dodge any incoming attacks. He'll be invincible for the duration of the move.</li>
                    <li>Reworked melee combat. Sonic can now perform sword combos with Caliburn if the player repeatedly presses <kbd>Fire</kbd>, and the slam attack is now simply performed with <kbd>Crouch</kbd>.</li>
                    <li>Brought back the Soul Surge, now activated by performing the Homing Snap with Caliburn and attacking.</li>
                    <li>The Accelerated Pistol now uses a burst fire instead of being fully automatic, and uses a bit more Chaos Energy.</li>
                    <li>Greatly nerfed Wall Jump.</li>
                    <li>Force Shot can now be done twice in quick succession.</li>
                    <li>Eclipse Blaster Mk. V now fires in a series of short bursts with extended end lag, to incentivise quickswapping.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed Hyper Sonic's speed to be the same as Super Sonic. This also applies to Classic Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed Boost, Sonic can no longer hold it in the air unless Super and Hyper, and speed is nerfed so you must now build up speed to Boost Jump effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Amy</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added the ability to slide.</li>
                    <li>Amy can now use the Piko Piko Hammer to parry incoming attacks, which allows her to reflect projectiles, at the cost of her Chaos Energy.</li>
                    <li>Greatly changed how the Piko Piko Hammer works, requiring the right timing for attacking and Hammer Jumping, and removing Hammer Gliding.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Classic Sonic</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Spin Attack, Insta-Shield and Drop Dash.</li>
                    <li>Spin Dash mechanics have been reworked. It's now activated with simply <kbd>Fire</kbd> instead of <kbd>Crouch</kbd>+<kbd>Fire</kbd>.</li>
                    <li>Can no longer punch.</li>
                    <li>Super/Hyper Sonic can now hover.</li>
                    <li>Drift no longer generates Chaos Energy mid-air.</li>
                    <li>Sonic Thok can no longer be aimed left, right or backwards.</li>
                    <li>Sonic Thok can now be activated by pressing <kbd>Jump</kbd> mid-air, like in SRB2.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Shadow</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chaos Spear can now be used at any time, as Shadow's Offhand Attack.</li>
                    <li>The Dual Assimilator is now more powerful and a lot more risky to use in a small space.</li>
                    <li>Shadow will be able to Chaos Snap thrice if holding the Chaos Emerald.</li>
                    <li>Shadow is now invincible when performing the Chaos Snap.</li>
                    <li>Added the Sub-Machine Gun, as Shadow's starter weapon.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Title theme is now Un-gravitify.</li>
                    <li>Updated secret bosses.</li>
                    <li>Fixed title screen not displaying correctly on GNU/Linux systems.</li>
                    <li>Added Reserved Mode, a mode that nerfs player movement to fit regular DOOM levels better.</li>
                    <li>A Discord App ID has been added. I'm unsure as to how Discord RPC works, but it's there.</li>
                    <li>If <code>DOOM2.WAD</code> was found in your GZDoom folder, it will be loaded automatically.</li>
                    <li>The "Hell on Earth" chapter (as well as all other chapters) will now be hidden from the main menu. You can still access these levels with the <code>idclev</code> cheat or the <code>map</code> console command.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>More to come!</strong> Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4 is still in development.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.3">Version 1.3.3</a></h3>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.3 is a minor update, containing some changes to the game&#39;s fundamentals and balancing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Shuriken Crossbow damage output and end frames.</li>
                    <li>Both Eclipse Blasters&#39; knockback has been significantly reduced.</li>
                    <li>Increased Piko Piko Hammer damage output.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Emeralds won&#39;t replace soulspheres or megaspheres, instead only replacing the BFG9000.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Energy will now rapidly decrease in Dark or Hyper form instead of deducting 2 at once. This is more of a visual change.</li>
                    <li>The amount of energy you get from capsules is now reduced if you&#39;re in Super, Dark or Hyper form.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Rings will now give you extra Chaos Energy if transformed (2 for Super, 4 for Hyper and Dark).</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the Recoil Burst would still cost Chaos Energy when transformed.</li>
                </ul>

				<p>Well, what are you waiting for? Download it now and experience the next level! ... Whatever that means.</p>
                <p>This is normally the part where the changelog would go, but it's <em>massive</em>, and I'm lazy, so... just go to the GitHub release page.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.0-chaos">Version 1.0</a></h3>
                <p>
                    It's been a long, rough road, but we're finally here.<br>
                    The long-awaited first release for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, the Chaos Update, is finally out!<br>
                    So without further ado... <strong>Welcome to the next level.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chaos Update is a turning point for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, becoming more than a simple DOOM mod some bored guy threw together after watching Peter Knetter videos.</p>
                <a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/compare/dark...v1.0-chaos">Full changelog <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>

                <h2>Pre-releases</h2>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/dark">Dark (0.9)</a></h3>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's Dark Update adds Shadow the Hedgehog! It's time to go and find that damn FOURTH Chaos Emerald!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Shadow the Hedgehog.</li>
                    <li>Added a taunt command which can be bound in the GZDoom settings.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn now has a rotating attack outside of Super Sonic.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/rose">Rose (0.8)</a></h3>
                <p>Oh boy! The Rose Update! This is probably the greatest addition to the mod in ages.</p>
                <p>This update marks the project's name change from 'Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM' to 'Sonic: Lock &amp; Load'.</p>
                <p>This was done:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>as both a reference to His World from Sonic '06</li>
                    <li>because I didn't want Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM (or Sonic DOOM) to be confused with Sonic Robo Blast 2, which is what most people think of when they hear "Sonic DOOM" (which didn't work at all, even YouTube thinks S:L&amp;L is SRB2)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's the changes:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Renamed Sonic's Eclipse Blaster to the "Eclipse Blaster Mk. V"</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed the Speedy Shotgun. </li>
                    <li>Removed the tutorial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v5-release">Ascension (0.7)</a></h3>
                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM's Ascension Update grants Sonic a revamped Boost that lets him ascend! (hence the title)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed how the Boost works.</li>
                    <li>Removed the Drift.</li>
                    <li>Added an unarmed kick.</li>
                    <li>DOOM II text screens reflect Sonic's dialogue and mimic Sonic Adventure 2's recap screens.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v4b-release">Eclipse (0.6)</a></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added the Eclipse Blaster.</li>
                    <li>Changed how the Speedy Shotgun works.</li>
                    <li>Drifting now recharges Chaos Energy.</li>
                    <li>Weapon pickup messages now reflect Sonic's reactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v3b-release">Knight of the Wind (0.5)</a></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Caliburn.</li>
                    <li>Super Sonic now improves melee attacks.</li>
                    <li>Replaced megaarmor with Soul Rings.</li>
