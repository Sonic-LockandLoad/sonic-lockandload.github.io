            <p>
                Sonic: Lock & Load is a Sonic the Hedgehog-based first-person shooter on the
                <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a> source port, currently a mod that requires DOOM 2's IWAD.
            </p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load is free software under the 3-clause BSD license.</p>
            <p>It's not really based on any kind of Sonic game in particular, instead taking inspiration from the entire franchise.</p>
            <p>It's also currently <em>very</em> unfinished, and development is kind of slow.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load is a project by <a href="https://that1m8head.github.io/">Arsalan Kazmi</a>.</p>

                <h2>Pre-releases</h2>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/dark">Dark (0.9)</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Dark Update! This has been one of my favourite updates to make! (wait till you see what's coming next, seriously, it's fricking crazy)<br>
                    This update adds Shadow the Hedgehog! Will he find that damn fourth Chaos Emerald?<br>
                    Also, I learned ACS!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a taunt command which can be bound in the GZDoom settings.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn now has a rotating attack outside of Super Sonic.</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Amy.</li>
                    <li>Hammer Jump is now triggered by crouching and pressing primary fire.</li>
                    <li>Added Shadow the Hedgehog.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/rose">Rose (0.8)</a></h3>
                <p>Oh boy! The Rose Update! This is probably the greatest addition to the mod in ages.</p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, I changed the name of the project to 'Sonic: Lock & Load' as both a reference to <em>His
                    World</em> from <em>Sonic '06</em>, and because I didn't want <em>Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM</em> (commonly
                    abbreviated as <em>Sonic DOOM</em>) to be confused  with <em>Sonic Robo Blast 2</em>, a much better fan game made
                    on a modified version of the <em>DOOM Legacy</em> source port, which can also be called <em>Sonic DOOM</em>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Amy Rose.</li>
                    <li>Renamed Sonic's Eclipse Blaster to the "Eclipse Blaster Mk. V"</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed the Speedy Shotgun. </li>
                    <li>Removed the tutorial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v5-release">Ascension (0.7)</a></h3>
                <ul>
