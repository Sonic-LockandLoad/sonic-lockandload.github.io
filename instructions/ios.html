            <h1>Installing on iOS</h1>
            <p>You can't. Sorry.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/1807486">As explained by Graf Zahl</a>, because of App Store policies, there is no official or even unofficial GZDoom port available for iOS or iPadOS.</p>
            <p>So you can't play Sonic: Lock & Load on an iPhone or an iPad.</p>
            <img class="framed" src="pretend-its-an-iphone.png" alt="Gez says 'Buy an Android phone and an Apple sticker, glue Apple sticker on Android phone, pretend it's an iPhone from now on.'">
            <p>Maybe one day, someone will make a fully-functional up-to-date iOS variant of GZDoom, but today isn't one of those days.</p>
            <p>Regardless, here's not-very-useful-at-all instructions on how to do it yourself.</p>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p id="redquoteblock"><strong>WARNING!! WARNING WARNING WARNING:</strong> These instructions are not verified even slightly. What follows may or may not be a good idea and isn't even complete like at all.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GZDoom's source code</li>
                <li>A Mac (you need a Mac for any iOS development)</li>
                <li>CMake</li>
                <li>Xcode</li>
                <li>A paid Apple Developer account</li>
                <li>Willpower</li>
                <li>Foolishness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Okay so you just build the source code inside of Xcode using CMake or however the hell it works.</p>
            <p>I dunno, I'm not an iOS developer.</p>
            <p>You also probably need to include somewhere to put the IWADs as well as the Sonic: Lock & Load PK3.</p>
            <h2>And that's it(!)</h2>
            <p>Once you build it by some act of God, congratulations, now you can not put it on the App Store, because, again, Apple's guidelines.</p>
            <p>I'm sorry if you thought these instructions would be legitimate.</p>
