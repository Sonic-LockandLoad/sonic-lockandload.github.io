            <h3>Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>
            <p>Sonic is a blend of Sonic: Lock & Load's Modern and Classic Sonic, with super high mobility, but with an air of classic DOOM-ness.</p>
            <p>He can blast through the levels much faster than Doomguy would be able to, and he doesn't even need a rocket-powered wheelchair to do it!</p>
            <p>A lot of his weapons and movement skills can be tied together for high speed and fast action gameplay.</p>
            <h4>Skills</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kick</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Attack</kbd> <br> Sonic can kick enemies at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Spin Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> on the ground <br> Sonic can rev up in ball form and launch himself towards any enemies! Despite being an Offhand Ability, it DOES deal damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Drop Dash</strong> - <kbd>Offhand Ability</kbd> in the air <br> Sonic can charge up a Spin Dash mid-air and launch as soon as he touches the ground. It doesn't go as far as Spin Dash, but it's still pretty useful.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Caliburn</strong> - Sonic's personal talking sword from a dimension of stories.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sword Swing</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Swing Caliburn from side to side. Hold down <kbd>Fire</kbd> to continuously swing. Attacks multiple times in a single hit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boost</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> Make Sonic zoom forward at high speed. The longer you hold, the faster it'll go. Press <kbd>Jump</kbd> to perform a Boost Jump, which preserves the Boost's momentum and gives Sonic a height boost. Can be held mid-air, unlike its S:L&L counterpart.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Speedforce Pistol</strong> - A railshot pistol that can send Sonic flying back quite a bit.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speedforce Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a weak railgun shot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Charged Burst</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a strong railgun shot.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Speedy Shotgun</strong> - An automatic shotgun with a burst fire.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speedy Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a rapid shotgun blast.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Eclipse Blaster</strong> - An enhanced plasma rifle that has the ability to heal.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eclipse Shot</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br>Fire a stream of plasma that deals continuous damage to enemies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos Restoration</strong> - <kbd>Alt-Fire</kbd> <br> The Eclipse Blaster can heal Sonic. It doesn't waste as much Energy as the S:L&L version, so go nuts.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Rocket Stream</strong> - A rapid fire rocket launcher that can be used for rocket jumping.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stream Launch</strong> - <kbd>Fire</kbd> <br> Fire a stream of rockets that launch targets far, including Sonic. Sonic takes less damage from his own rockets, so you can get away with rocket jumping.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
