            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM: Legacy Edition is a Sonic gameplay mod for DOOM, and a side project based on Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, which is a hyper-fast, action packed first-person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games and built on <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a>.</p>
            <p>Legacy Edition, itself, is a remake and evolution of Sonic: Lock & Load's earlier versions, specifically versions v0.1 to v0.7, for the modern era, with the amount of polish you would expect for Sonic: Lock & Load.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, as well as Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM: Legacy Edition, is a project by <a href="https://that1m8head.github.io/">Arsalan Kazmi</a>, free software under the <a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/blob/edge/LICENSE.txt">3-clause BSD license</a>.</p>
            <h2>Where are the releases?</h2>
            <p>Unlike its big brother, StHiD: Legacy uses dates, like 2023-04-10, instead of version numbers, like v1.3.3 and v1.4.</p>
            <p>The reason for this is that this project is less important than Sonic: Lock & Load, and so more updates can be pushed out, and I don't have to keep coming up for version numbers, which means less stress for me.</p>
