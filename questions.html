            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</em></h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Is Sonic: Lock &amp; Load related at all to Sonic Robo Blast 2?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                No - SRB2 is a completely different project from Sonic: Lock &amp; Load.
                                SRB2 is a Sonic fan game that was made in the image of the original Genesis games,
                                while Sonic: Lock and Load is a first person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series,
                                with an attempt to blend elements of Sonic and DOOM together.
                            </p>
                            <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load has nothing to do with any other Sonic + DOOM thingy you may have seen around. I promise.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>How do I play this thing?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                You need <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a> and a copy of DOOM. If you don't want to buy DOOM, <a href="https://freedoom.github.io">Freedoom</a> will work just as well.
                                You should use either DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2 if you want to play any Lock &amp; Load specific content.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why is Classic Sonic in the game?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>I wanted to bring back the original style from Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's predecessor. He's not just a Sonic clone -- he's his own character.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Where can I ask about or complain about the mod?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>You can leave an <a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/issues/new/choose">issue</a> on the GitHub repo.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why aren't Tails or Knuckles playable??</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>The former because I can't draw sprites for Tails that look good, and the latter because I don't know what gameplay style Knuckles would have.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why do big rings only give you up to 300 rings?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>Balancing reasons. Prior to S:L&amp;L v1.0, they used to give you up to 999, which basically gave you enough health to practically just walk through every level nonchalantly.</p></li>
                        <li><p>In addition, the player character will take extra damage if their ring count exceeds 300. Again, for balancing.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Can you add Big the Cat?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>No.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>Because no.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why don't you make your own assets?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>I'm not a talented artist. If I were able to, I would, but art, especially sprite art, is hard.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><strong>Why is Amy's in-game sprite based on her Classic design, but the art used is her Modern design?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li><p>Read the above.</p></li>
                    </ul>
