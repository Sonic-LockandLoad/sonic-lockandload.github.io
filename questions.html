            <ul>
                <li style="line-height:2.5"><strong>Is Sonic: Lock & Load related at all to Sonic Robo Blast 2?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>
                            No - SRB2 is a completely different project from Sonic: Lock & Load.
                            SRB2 is a Sonic fan game that was made in the image of the original Genesis games,
                            while Sonic: Lock and Load is a first person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series,
                            with an attempt to blend elements of Sonic and DOOM together.
                            <br>
                            Sonic: Lock & Load has nothing to do with any other Sonic + DOOM thingy you may have seen around. I promise.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li style="line-height:2.5"><strong>How do I play this thing?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>
                            You need <a href="https://www.zdoom.org">GZDoom</a> and a copy of DOOM. If you don't want to buy DOOM, <a href="https://freedoom.github.io">Freedoom</a> will work just as well.
                            You should use either DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2 if you want to play any Lock & Load specific content.

                    </ul>
                <li style="line-height:2.5"><strong>Why is Classic Sonic in the game?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>I wanted to bring back the original style from Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, Sonic: Lock & Load's predecessor. He's not just a Sonic clone -- he's his own character.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li style="line-height:2.5"><strong>Where can I ask about or complain about the mod?</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>You can leave an <a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/issues">issue</a> on the GitHub repo.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li style="line-height:2.5"><strong>Why aren't Tails or Knuckles playable??</strong></li>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                        <li>The former because I can't draw sprites for Tails that look good, and the latter because I don't know what gameplay style Knuckles would have.</li>
                    </ul>
