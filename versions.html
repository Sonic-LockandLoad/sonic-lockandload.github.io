            <h1>Version History</h1>
            <p>The current version of Sonic: Lock & Load is <strong>v1.4 "Horizons"</strong>, part of <strong>Season 1: Chaos</strong>.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load follows a variant of Semantic Versioning, where instead of <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> it uses <code>SEASON.RELEASE.UPDATE</code>.</p>
            <p>Seasons are game overhauls or enormous content updates. Releases are large updates which add a lot of features and content. Updates are used for minor feature additions, refinements and bug fixes.</p>
            <p>Includes major releases only. v1.1 and v1.2 are not present because they were retroactively changed to v1.0.1 and v1.0.2.</p>
            <p>Note that the GitHub Releases entries for versions prior to v1.4 "Horizons" will not be updated to use the new 2024 version names, because that's a lot of work and I don't care enough to do that.</p>

            <h1 id="season-1">Season 1: Chaos</h1>
            <p>Season 1: Chaos focuses on Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's formative development cycle, building on top of DOOM II up until the point where independence can be achieved.</p>
            <p>Once Sonic: Lock &amp; Load can be developed and played without DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2, it'll move onto Season 2, of which is currently unnamed.</p>
            <div class="releases">  
                <h2 id="v1.4.1">Version v1.4.1 "Vibrant Horizons"</h2>
                <p><strong>This update is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.</strong></p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4.1 "Vibrant Horizons" is a massive improvement to the existing Horizons update, focusing on improving and refining many of the new features added in v1.4 "Horizons".</p>
                <p>Admittedly I kind of had too much fun with this update. It's barely even an update - it may as well be a release, but it doesn't feel release-y to me.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revamped Levels:</strong> Vibrant Gardens replaces Sunset Gardens, and is a massively revamped version of that level. Marble Madness has seen massive improvements, and Oceanic Fortress has been overhauled completely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Super Sonic Style:</strong> Style System is now mandatory and ingrained into the all-new scoring system, acting as a score multiplier, and incorporating style bonuses inspired by ULTRAKILL. The system as a whole is a lot more cohesive and refined.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movement Plus:</strong> Every character can now use the Wall Jump, even Classic Sonic. It wasn't worth not giving him it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enemy Jump:</strong> v1.4.1's killer feature is the "Enemy Jump", allowing the player to perform a Wall Jump off an enemy.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Milestones:</strong> Ever wanted an excuse to search the levels inside and out? A new X Rank has been added, for achieving S Rank plus finding all secrets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Return To Cyber Space:</strong> Cyber Space Arena has seen an enormous facelift, with new customisation options in the menu.</li>
                    <li><strong>All-New Station Square:</strong> Station Square has seen a massive overhaul, trumping even the change from v1.0.x to v1.4.</li>
                    <li><strong>General Gameplay Stuff:</strong> Each of the characters have been meticulously refined in order to make them all fun to play. So no matter who your favourite is, you'll have a blast.</li>
                    <li><strong>And Other Things Also:</strong> v1.4.1 includes a bunch of bug fixes and gameplay tweaks in order to make the game more fun and less tedious. Whatever your style, Vibrant Horizons is sure to put a smile on your face. Probably.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v1.4"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Version v1.4 "Horizons"</a></h2>
                <p>Surge Through the Horizons.</p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4 “Horizons” is a major update, bringing
                    new levels, new techniques, refinements to the changes made in v1.3.3 and
                    major changes to the gameplay and Sonic: Lock &amp; Load’s fundamentals.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I had some troubles with SFGHQ and SAGE 2022, resulting in me making a "Final Final Demo".
                    <a href="v1.4-struggles.html">You can read about the development history and struggles here.</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Levels:</strong> Sunset Gardens, Marble Madness and Oceanic Fortress.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Techniques:</strong> Offhand command split into Offhand Attack and Offhand Ability, providing special abilities for each character. New Crouch Slide ability for all characters. The Slam Attack and Wall Jump can now be used by (mostly) everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Weapons:</strong> New weapons and rebalanced and updated weapons for everyone. Shadow gets his infamous pump-action MP5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refinements:</strong> Various changes to the gameplay and fixed and rebalanced behaviours and mechanics from v1.3.x. Super Forms have been rebalanced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> Movement changes, ULTRAKILL-style movement, rebalanced double jump and full speed is now always on. Difficulty levels have seen an overhaul.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyber Space Arena:</strong> A new endless arena level where you can fight endlessly spawning enemies until you fail, inspired by Sonic Frontiers' Cyber Space.</li>
                    <li><strong>And Other Things Also:</strong> New title screen, new logo, new branding, new end-level ranking system, Discord Rich Presence support, DOOM II levels turned off by default, and so on.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.3 is a minor update, containing some changes to the game&#39;s fundamentals and balancing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Shuriken Crossbow damage output and end frames.</li>
                    <li>Both Eclipse Blasters&#39; knockback has been significantly reduced.</li>
                    <li>Increased Piko Piko Hammer damage output.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Emeralds won&#39;t replace soulspheres or megaspheres, instead only replacing the BFG9000.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Energy will now rapidly decrease in Dark or Hyper form instead of deducting 2 at once. This is more of a visual change.</li>
                    <li>The amount of energy you get from capsules is now reduced if you&#39;re in Super, Dark or Hyper form.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Rings will now give you extra Chaos Energy if transformed (2 for Super, 4 for Hyper and Dark).</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the Recoil Burst would still cost Chaos Energy when transformed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>v1.1 and v1.2 were incorrectly named.</strong> They have since been retroactively changed to v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 to align with proper semantic versioning.</p>
                <p>Officially, v1.3 is the next version after v1.0.2. I'm not changing it to v1.1 because that would offset all later versions, and I can't be asked to deal with the headache that's going to bring.</p>

                <h2 id="v1.0.2"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.2">Version v1.0.2 "Unabridged Chaos"</a></h2>
                <p>Like with v1.0.1, this used to be v1.2, changed to align with proper semantic versioning.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homing Attack improvements.</li>
                    <li>Spin Dash improvements.</li>
                    <li>Removed the Light Speed Attack.</li>

                </p>
                <p>The Chaos Update is a turning point for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, becoming more than a simple DOOM mod some bored guy threw together after watching Peter Knetter videos.</p>

            <h2 id="season-0">Season 0: Genesis</h2>
            <p>This is <em>technically</em> the first season of Sonic: Lock &amp; Load (or Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM as it was known before v0.8 "Rose"), representing the stages of development where I was still getting used to DOOM modding. These releases laid the groundwork for the subsequent Season 1, which is the first proper season.</p>
            <div class="releases">
                <h2 id="v0.9"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/dark">Version v0.9 "Dark"</a></h2>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's Dark Update adds Shadow the Hedgehog! It's time to go and find that damn FOURTH Chaos Emerald!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Shadow the Hedgehog.</li>
                    <li>Added a taunt command which can be bound in the GZDoom settings.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn now has a rotating attack outside of Super Sonic.</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Amy.</li>

                <p>Oh boy! The Rose Update! This is probably the greatest addition to the mod in ages.</p>
                <p>This update marks the project's name change from 'Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM' to 'Sonic: Lock &amp; Load'.</p>
                <p>This was done:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>as both a reference to His World from Sonic '06</li>
                    <li>because I didn't want Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM (or Sonic DOOM) to be confused with Sonic Robo Blast 2, which is what most people think of when they hear "Sonic DOOM" (which didn't work at all, even YouTube thinks S:L&amp;L is SRB2)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's the changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Amy Rose.</li>
                    <li>Renamed Sonic's Eclipse Blaster to the "Eclipse Blaster Mk. V"</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed the Speedy Shotgun. </li>
                    <li>Removed the tutorial.</li>
