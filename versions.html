            <h1>Version History</h1>
            <p>The current version of Sonic: Lock & Load is <strong>v1.4 "Horizons"</strong>, part of <strong>Season 1: Chaos</strong>.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load follows a variant of Semantic Versioning, where instead of <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> it uses <code>SEASON.RELEASE.UPDATE</code>.</p>
            <p>Seasons are game overhauls or enormous content updates. Releases are large updates which add a lot of features and content. Updates are used for minor feature additions, refinements and bug fixes.</p>
            <p>Includes major releases only. v1.1 and v1.2 are not included because they're essentially updates to v1.0.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#season-1">Season 1: Chaos</a> - v1.0..ongoing</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#v1.4">v1.4 "Horizons"</a> - v1.4..ongoing</li>
                    <li><a href="#v1.3">v1.3</a> - v1.3..v1.3.3</li>

                <li><a href="#season-0">Season 0: Legacy</a> - v0.1..v0.9</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="season-1">Season 1: Chaos</h1>
            <p>Chaos focuses on Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's formative development cycle, building on top of DOOM II up until the point where independence can be achieved.</p>
            <div class="releases">
                <h2 id="v1.4"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Version v1.4 "Horizons"</a></h2>
                <p>Surge Through the Horizons.</p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4 “Horizons” is a major update, bringing
                    new levels, new techniques, refinements to the changes made in v1.3.3 and
                    major changes to the gameplay and Sonic: Lock &amp; Load’s fundamentals.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I had some troubles with SFGHQ and SAGE 2022, resulting in me making a "Final Final Demo".
                    <a href="v1.4-struggles.html">You can read about the development history and struggles here.</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Levels:</strong> Sunset Gardens, Marble Madness and Oceanic Fortress.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Techniques:</strong> Offhand command split into Offhand Attack and Offhand Ability, providing special abilities for each character. New Crouch Slide ability for all characters. The Slam Attack and Wall Jump can now be used by (mostly) everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Weapons:</strong> New weapons and rebalanced and updated weapons for everyone. Shadow gets his infamous pump-action MP5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refinements:</strong> Various changes to the gameplay and fixed and rebalanced behaviours and mechanics from v1.3.x. Super Forms have been rebalanced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> Movement changes, ULTRAKILL-style movement, rebalanced double jump and full speed is now always on. Difficulty levels have seen an overhaul.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyber Space Arena:</strong> A new endless arena level where you can fight endlessly spawning enemies until you fail, inspired by Sonic Frontiers' Cyber Space.</li>
                    <li><strong>And Other Things Also:</strong> New title screen, new logo, new branding, new end-level ranking system, Discord Rich Presence support, DOOM II levels turned off by default, and so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="v1.3.3"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.3">Version v1.3.3</a></h2>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.3 is a minor update, containing some changes to the game&#39;s fundamentals and balancing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Shuriken Crossbow damage output and end frames.</li>
                    <li>Both Eclipse Blasters&#39; knockback has been significantly reduced.</li>
                    <li>Increased Piko Piko Hammer damage output.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Emeralds won&#39;t replace soulspheres or megaspheres, instead only replacing the BFG9000.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Energy will now rapidly decrease in Dark or Hyper form instead of deducting 2 at once. This is more of a visual change.</li>
                    <li>The amount of energy you get from capsules is now reduced if you&#39;re in Super, Dark or Hyper form.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Rings will now give you extra Chaos Energy if transformed (2 for Super, 4 for Hyper and Dark).</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the Recoil Burst would still cost Chaos Energy when transformed.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2 id="v1.3.2"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.2">Version v1.3.2</a></h2>
				<p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.2 is a semi-minor update.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sonic can now wall jump.</li>
					<li>The option for Slot 4 weapons to replace Slot 2 weapons has been removed.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue where completing Green Hill's boss was impossible.</li>
					<li>Directional inputs for Sonic Thok and Chaos Snap now work with controllers.</li>
				</ul>
						
                <h2 id="v1.3.1"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3.1">Version v1.3.1</a></h2>
				<p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.1 is a minor update involving mostly bug fixes.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Skill 5 (Blue Streak/Thorned Rose/Fun is infinite/All Fail Shadow) no longer gives enemies double health.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue where finishing a level as Shadow would end before the victory jingle played.</li>
					<li>Fixed an issue where Classic Sonic's mugshot wouldn't change when finishing a level.</li>
				</ul>

                <h2 id="v1.3"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.3">Version v1.3</a></h2>
				<p>Finally, a <strong>REAL</strong> update!</p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3 (which can be considered the real v1.1 but we won't get into that) adds an all-new Green Hill, a redesigned Station Square, new abilities and way more.</p>
				<p>We're getting closer and closer to SRB3...</p>
				<p>Well, what are you waiting for? Download it now and experience the next level! ... Whatever that means.</p>
                <p>This is normally the part where the changelog would go, but it's <em>massive</em>, and I'm lazy, so... just go to the GitHub release page.</p>

                <h2 id="v1.2"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.2">Version v1.2</a></h2>
                <p>Like with v1.1, this is basically v1.0.2.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homing Attack improvements.</li>
                    <li>Spin Dash improvements.</li>
                    <li>Removed the Light Speed Attack.</li>

                    <li>Code cleanups and bug fixes.</li>

                <p>This is basically v1.0.1. Man, I wish I knew about proper semantic versioning when I released this...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added the Spin Dash for Classic Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Added persistent control hints in each characters' tutorials that make learning the controls easier.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v1.0"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.0-chaos">Version v1.0</a></h2>
                <p>
                    It's been a long, rough road, but we're finally here.<br>
                    The long-awaited first release for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, the Chaos Update, is finally out!<br>
                    So without further ado... <strong>Welcome to the next level.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chaos Update is a turning point for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, becoming more than a simple DOOM mod some bored guy threw together after watching Peter Knetter videos.</p>

            </div>
            <h2 id="season-0">Season 0: Legacy</h2>
            <p>This is <em>technically</em> the first season of Sonic: Lock &amp; Load/Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM, representing the stages of development where I was still getting used to DOOM modding. These releases laid the groundwork for the subsequent Season 1, which is the first proper season.</p>
            <p>It's named "Legacy" because the version number is 0, and because of Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM: Legacy Edition's retroactive creation.</p>
            <div class="releases">
                <h2 id="v0.9"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/dark">Dark Update (v0.9)</a></h2>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's Dark Update adds Shadow the Hedgehog! It's time to go and find that damn FOURTH Chaos Emerald!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Shadow the Hedgehog.</li>
                    <li>Added a taunt command which can be bound in the GZDoom settings.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn now has a rotating attack outside of Super Sonic.</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Amy.</li>
                    <li>Hammer Jump is now triggered by crouching and pressing primary fire.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v0.8"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/rose">Rose Update (v0.8)</a></h2>
                <p>Oh boy! The Rose Update! This is probably the greatest addition to the mod in ages.</p>
                <p>This update marks the project's name change from 'Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM' to 'Sonic: Lock &amp; Load'.</p>
                <p>This was done:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>as both a reference to His World from Sonic '06</li>
                    <li>because I didn't want Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM (or Sonic DOOM) to be confused with Sonic Robo Blast 2, which is what most people think of when they hear "Sonic DOOM" (which didn't work at all, even YouTube thinks S:L&amp;L is SRB2)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's the changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Amy Rose.</li>
                    <li>Renamed Sonic's Eclipse Blaster to the "Eclipse Blaster Mk. V"</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed the Speedy Shotgun. </li>
                    <li>Removed the tutorial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v0.7"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v5-release">Ascension Update (v0.7)</a></h2>
                <p>Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM's Ascension Update grants Sonic a revamped Boost that lets him ascend! (hence the title)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed how the Boost works.</li>
                    <li>Removed the Drift.</li>
                    <li>Added an unarmed kick.</li>
                    <li>DOOM II text screens reflect Sonic's dialogue and mimic Sonic Adventure 2's recap screens.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v0.6"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v4b-release">Eclipse Update (v0.6)</a></h2>

                    <li>Added the Eclipse Blaster.</li>
                    <li>Changed how the Speedy Shotgun works.</li>
                    <li>Drifting now recharges Chaos Energy.</li>
                    <li>Weapon pickup messages now reflect Sonic's reactions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v0.5"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v3b-release">Knight of the Wind Update (v0.5)</a></h2>

                    <li>Added level time to the HUD.</li>
                </ul>
