            <h1>Version History</h1>
            <p>The current version of Sonic: Lock & Load is <strong>v1.4 "Horizons"</strong>, part of <strong>Season 1: Chaos</strong>.</p>
            <p>Sonic: Lock & Load follows a variant of Semantic Versioning, where instead of <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> it uses <code>SEASON.RELEASE.UPDATE</code>.</p>
            <p>Seasons are game overhauls or enormous content updates. Releases are large updates which add a lot of features and content. Updates are used for minor feature additions, refinements and bug fixes.</p>
            <p>Includes major releases only. v1.1 and v1.2 are not present because they were retroactively changed to v1.0.1 and v1.0.2.</p>
            <p>Note that the GitHub Releases entries for versions prior to v1.4 "Horizons" will not be updated to use the new 2024 version names, because that's a lot of work and I don't care enough to do that.</p>

            <h1 id="season-1">Season 1: Chaos</h1>
            <p>Season 1: Chaos focuses on Sonic: Lock &amp; Load's formative development cycle, building on top of DOOM II up until the point where independence can be achieved.</p>
            <p>Once Sonic: Lock &amp; Load can be developed and played without DOOM II or Freedoom: Phase 2, it'll move onto Season 2, of which is currently unnamed.</p>
            <div class="releases">  
                <h2 id="v1.4.1">Version v1.4.1 "Vibrant Horizons"</h2>
                <p><strong>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4.1 "Vibrant Horizons"</strong> is an update to the existing v1.4 "Horizons" update, providing refinements, polishes, a new and improved Style System, a real scoring system, less tedious level layouts, an expanded lobby, an all-new first level, and more.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> A new scoring system has supplanted the old system based on defeated enemies. This new system will now track an actual score variable, which is incremented by dealing damage and defeating enemies, multiplied by your current Style Rank, and decremented by taking damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Checkpoints:</strong></li> Checkpoints have been added to the levels, so if you lose all your Rings after having already touched a checkpoint, you'll restart from that checkpoint instead of restarting the entire level.
                    <li><strong>Style System:</strong></li> The style system has been majorly rebalanced and tightly integrated into the scoring system, with all new style bonuses in the vein of ULTRAKILL.
                    <li><strong>Refined Levels:</strong></li> Level 1, Vibrant Gardens, replacing Sunset Gardens from v1.4, features a much brighter and more vibrant (ehhhh???) colour palette, and it looks even *more* like Green Hill Zone than it ever did before. Marble Madness and Oceanic Fortress have also seen minor improvements aimed at reducing the tedium in the levels, though these levels still could do with more of a facelift...
                    <li><strong>Smoother Gameplay:</strong></li> The characters and weapons have been tweaked to provide a more fun and cohesive experience - to list a few off, Classic Sonic can now wall jump, Shadow can now parry melee attacks with the High Shovel, and Sonic can now keep enemies in the air with the Accelerated Pistol, among a frick of a lot more additions and improvements.
                    <li><strong>The Road to Nightfall:</strong></li> Shadow has seen quite the improvement in v1.4.1 - he has been given a new weapon, the Chaos Reaper, a crossbow/sniper/plasma shotgun type thing, and the Dark Assaulter automatic shotgun has been removed for the sake of cohesion, since it was redundant to give him a weapon that's basically a combination of two of his existing weapons.
                    <li><strong>And Much, Much More:</strong></li> Alongside everything mentioned so far, Sonic: Lock & Load v1.4.1 "Vibrant Horizons" includes some much-needed improvements over issues that were prevalent in v1.4 "Horizons". Whatever you're looking for in this Sonic + DOOM + Devil May Cry hybrid, Vibrant Horizons is sure to make it way, way better. (I hope.)
                </ul>

                <h2 id="v1.4"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Version v1.4 "Horizons"</a></h2>
                <p>Surge Through the Horizons.</p>
                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.4 “Horizons” is a major update, bringing
                    new levels, new techniques, refinements to the changes made in v1.3.3 and
                    major changes to the gameplay and Sonic: Lock &amp; Load’s fundamentals.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I had some troubles with SFGHQ and SAGE 2022, resulting in me making a "Final Final Demo".
                    <a href="v1.4-struggles.html">You can read about the development history and struggles here.</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Levels:</strong> Sunset Gardens, Marble Madness and Oceanic Fortress.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Techniques:</strong> Offhand command split into Offhand Attack and Offhand Ability, providing special abilities for each character. New Crouch Slide ability for all characters. The Slam Attack and Wall Jump can now be used by (mostly) everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>New Weapons:</strong> New weapons and rebalanced and updated weapons for everyone. Shadow gets his infamous pump-action MP5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refinements:</strong> Various changes to the gameplay and fixed and rebalanced behaviours and mechanics from v1.3.x. Super Forms have been rebalanced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> Movement changes, ULTRAKILL-style movement, rebalanced double jump and full speed is now always on. Difficulty levels have seen an overhaul.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyber Space Arena:</strong> A new endless arena level where you can fight endlessly spawning enemies until you fail, inspired by Sonic Frontiers' Cyber Space.</li>
                    <li><strong>And Other Things Also:</strong> New title screen, new logo, new branding, new end-level ranking system, Discord Rich Presence support, DOOM II levels turned off by default, and so on.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Sonic: Lock &amp; Load v1.3.3 is a minor update, containing some changes to the game&#39;s fundamentals and balancing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased Shuriken Crossbow damage output and end frames.</li>
                    <li>Both Eclipse Blasters&#39; knockback has been significantly reduced.</li>
                    <li>Increased Piko Piko Hammer damage output.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Emeralds won&#39;t replace soulspheres or megaspheres, instead only replacing the BFG9000.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Energy will now rapidly decrease in Dark or Hyper form instead of deducting 2 at once. This is more of a visual change.</li>
                    <li>The amount of energy you get from capsules is now reduced if you&#39;re in Super, Dark or Hyper form.</li>
                    <li>Chaos Rings will now give you extra Chaos Energy if transformed (2 for Super, 4 for Hyper and Dark).</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue where the Recoil Burst would still cost Chaos Energy when transformed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>v1.1 and v1.2 were incorrectly named.</strong> They have since been retroactively changed to v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 to align with proper semantic versioning.</p>
                <p>Officially, v1.3 is the next version after v1.0.2. I'm not changing it to v1.1 because that would offset all later versions, and I can't be asked to deal with the headache that's going to bring.</p>

                <h2 id="v1.0.2"><a href="https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/releases/tag/v1.2">Version v1.0.2 "Unabridged Chaos"</a></h2>
                <p>Like with v1.0.1, this used to be v1.2, changed to align with proper semantic versioning.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homing Attack improvements.</li>
                    <li>Spin Dash improvements.</li>
                    <li>Removed the Light Speed Attack.</li>

                </p>
                <p>The Chaos Update is a turning point for Sonic: Lock &amp; Load, becoming more than a simple DOOM mod some bored guy threw together after watching Peter Knetter videos.</p>

            <h2 id="season-0">Season 0: Genesis</h2>
            <p>This is <em>technically</em> the first season of Sonic: Lock &amp; Load (or Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM as it was known before v0.8 "Rose"), representing the stages of development where I was still getting used to DOOM modding. These releases laid the groundwork for the subsequent Season 1, which is the first proper season.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Added Shadow the Hedgehog.</li>
                    <li>Added a taunt command which can be bound in the GZDoom settings.</li>
                    <li>Caliburn now has a rotating attack outside of Super Sonic.</li>

                <p>Oh boy! The Rose Update! This is probably the greatest addition to the mod in ages.</p>
                <p>This update marks the project's name change from 'Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM' to 'Sonic: Lock &amp; Load'.</p>
                <p>This was done:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>as both a reference to His World from Sonic '06</li>
                    <li>because I didn't want Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM (or Sonic DOOM) to be confused with Sonic Robo Blast 2, which is what most people think of when they hear "Sonic DOOM" (which didn't work at all, even YouTube thinks S:L&amp;L is SRB2)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's the changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added Amy Rose.</li>
                    <li>Renamed Sonic's Eclipse Blaster to the "Eclipse Blaster Mk. V"</li>
                    <li>New mugshot sprites for Sonic.</li>
                    <li>Nerfed the Speedy Shotgun. </li>
